{"prompt": "A software engineer is tasked with creating a program that can distinguish between real and fake news articles. The program is given a set of 100 articles, half of which are real and half of which are fake. The engineer must create an algorithm that correctly identifies at least 90% of the real articles and at least 85% of the fake articles. \nTo make the task more challenging, the engineer is only allowed to analyze the first 5 words of each article. Additionally, they must also take into account the date the article was published, as real news articles tend to be published within a few days of the event they are reporting on, while fake news articles can be published at any time. \nCan the engineer successfully create a program that meets these requirements? If so, how would they go about doing it? If not, what are the limitations of the current technology?"}

{"prompt": "a. As a travel agent, you are often asked by travelers about how to identify the coins of Upper Scholaria. You decide\n\nit would be useful to develop an expert system which customers could consult directly. You phone the local school to ask if any pupils studying Higher Information Systems would like a temporary post as a knowledge engineer. Shortly afterward, Lucinda arrives. She explains that she has been studying Expert Systems at school and will be pleased to develop the expert system for you. Lucinda begins by analysing the problem. She searches the internet for websites about Scholaria and finds some information about its monetary system. She makes notes about the different types of coins. She is not clear about the difference between a 202 coin and a 502 coin, so she phones a domain expert the receptionist at La Hotel Granda in the capital city of Scholaria. This soon clarifies the difference. Here is a summary of Lucinda's notes: There are 7 different coins, with values 12, 62, 102, 202, 502, 1P, and 6P. The 12 and 62 coins are made from bronze. All the rest are silver, except for the 6P which is \"two-tones\" (bronze in the center with a silver edge around it). The 12, 62, 102, and 502 are normal round coins The 202 and 6P are 7-sided, and the 1P is a bizarre triangular coin. The 3 lowest value coins are all 18mm diameter, the 208 and 50 are 22mm, the (triangular) is 25mm across, and the 63 is the largest at 30mm across All these coins have symbols on them. There is a fish on the 12, 62, 202, and 50Z coins. The 102 has a flower, the IP has a mountain, and the 6 has a bird. Develop: (i) factor table (ii) reduced decision tree (ii) rule base for the Expert System\n\nb.

{"prompt": "Increasingly, however, the evidence shows that\u2019s not the case.\nOne study by BlackRock BLK, +0.03% looked at how traditional indexes (U.S., ex-US and Emerging Markets) performed compared to ESG-focused indexes and found that, from May 2012 through February 2018, ESG returns matched or exceeded those of unconstrained indexes. The biggest gap was in emerging markets, which are less efficient in general and differences in corporate governance tend to be greater. In this case, the MSCI Emerging Markets benchmark was outperformed by a similar index with an ESG focus by nearly 2 percentage points.\nBut those years were primarily salad days for investments of nearly any stripe, with little volatility to trip up even the most risk-on investment manager. The real question on investors\u2019 minds has been how ESG and RI managers will fare when markets trend down or sideways, as well as up?\nUntil 2018, investors couldn\u2019t really know. After all, stock markets have been in an extended bull run since March 9, 2009. But last year, markets experienced two brief, but extreme, periods of uncertainty \u2014 and ESG and RI funds performed quite well.\nIn February 2018, investors got their first real taste of post-Great Financial Recession volatility, when the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19% fell 7.2% in the first nine days of the month. During that brief period, fund watcher Morningstar determined that 65% of so-called \u201csustainable\u201d equity funds, a common euphemism for RI, outperformed their peers.\nThen the drop in stocks accelerated into Christmas. Yet the strong showing for these funds held up.\nMorningstar\u2019s number-crunching found 67.8% of ESG and RI equity funds graced the top half of their investing peers for the full fourth quarter, and nearly two-thirds of them edging their way into the top half of fund performance for the full calendar year as well.\nOf course, there are many flavors of ESG and RI funds available, which, despite their shared moniker may have significant differences. Some funds may limit or exclude certain industries (tobacco, firearms, weapons of mass destruction, adult entertainment, or fossil fuels, for example) while others include all industries but attempt to separate ESG \u201cwinners\u201d from companies with poor environmental, social and governance characteristics. As a result, it can be difficult to make generalizations about ESG and RI funds.\nOther research confirms Hale\u2019s suspicions.\nBank of America studied the impact of ESG on future earnings and found that nonfinancial ESG data trumps other factors such as \u201cquality\u201d (measured by any number of financial metrics, such as profitability, earnings stability and leverage) and Return on Equity when it comes to signaling future earnings. They found more mean-reversion at work in the traditional factors, rather than the more predictive value of ESG data, which they found to be was more predictive of future earnings or financial success.\nIn addition, a paper from the UMEA School of Business, Economics and Statistics in Sweden found there is a \u201cstatistically significant negative relationship between high ESG/CSR performance and share price volatility\u201d which translates into lower volatility for higher ESG investments.\nObviously, not all ESG and RI funds outperformed during 2018\u2019s volatile markets, but a number of managers did edge their benchmarks for the quarter and/or year, even if they weren\u2019t among the most visible funds.\nHowever, one of 2018\u2019s largest ESG fund launches, the Goldman Sachs JUST U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF JUST, +0.00% dropped 14.13% during the fourth quarter of last year, according to Morningstar, while the S&P 500 fell 13.52%. The Vanguard ESG US Stock ETF ESGV, +0.00% another high-profile launch in 2018, declined 14.04% in the same period.\nIn contrast, Parnassus, which has the most assets under management in a dedicated group of ESG funds in the U.S., had a number of funds edge the S&P 500 during the quarter. The Parnassus Fund PARNX, -0.90% and Parnassus Core Equity PRBLX, -0.63% funds both fell less than the S&P 500 (down 13.04% and 9.61%, respectively), and the firm\u2019s midcap offering, the Parnassus Mid Cap Fund PARMX, -0.64% fell 11.18%, much less than the Russell Mid Cap\u2019s 15.4% drop.\nHere\u2019s a selected list of funds whose returns for the full fourth quarter ranked among the top 10% of their equity investing peers, based on Morningstar peer ratings.\nIt is important to note, however, that outperformance in the fourth quarter wasn\u2019t a guarantee of full-year dominance. Some of these funds underperformed either their benchmarks and/or peers for the full calendar year.\nObviously one nine-day and one three-month period do not a bear market make, and there are never guarantees that a strategy or fund will consistently experience positive performance or even relative outperformance.\nWhile there is certainly room for caution when making any investment decision, particularly one that may be based on loose definitions or implementation of ESG or specific value systems, investors are getting closer to the day when it\u2019s no longer assumed that investing responsibly or sustainably carries with it a performance penalty. What was the performance of ESG and RI equity funds during the volatile periods of 2018, according to Morningstar's data crunching?"}

{"prompt": "In a world where workplace safety is of utmost importance, there's a need for innovative training methods that can prepare employees to face hazardous scenarios. Imagine a scenario where virtual reality technology is used to create simulated hazardous workplace scenarios that employees can practice in. However, this training method comes with its own advantages and limitations.\nOne advantage of using VR simulations for workplace safety training is the ability to provide a realistic and immersive experience. Employees can practice responding to dangerous situations without risking actual harm. Additionally, VR simulations can be customized to mimic various types of hazardous scenarios, ensuring that employees are well-equipped to handle any situation they may face.\nHowever, there are also limitations to using VR simulations for workplace safety training. For instance, the cost of developing and implementing VR simulations can be prohibitive for many companies. Additionally, some employees may not be comfortable with using VR technology, which could hinder their ability to learn from the training.\nIn light of these advantages and limitations, it's clear that virtual reality technology has the potential to revolutionize workplace safety training. However, companies must carefully weigh the costs and benefits of this approach before deciding to implement it."}
{"prompt": "Which poem by Robert Service do you think is the most different from his usual style, and why? : Robert Service (1874 - 1958) was a Scottish poet who became smitten with the Yukon Territory when he moved to Canada at the age of 21. Though he longed to be a trail-blazing cowboy, and many thought he indeed lived the life of which he wrote, Robert was, in fact, a bank clerk. After wandering North America for several years, working at odd jobs and various bank branches, he finally settled down in Dawson City, Yukon, some time after the Gold Rush. Robert began writing poems about his stark and beautiful surroundings, and about the legends and lifestyle associated with that part of the world. When his collection of poetry, The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses, was published in 1907, it was an immediate success, made Robert wealthy beyond his greatest expectations, and earned him the nickname \"The Bard of the Yukon.\" Robert alternated living in North America and Europe for the remainder of his life--even spending a few years in Hollywood; the cabin in the Klondike where he made his home is now a Canadian national park site. Robert Service is one of my favorites, and a visit to Dawson City some years ago yielded a Service interpreter who was delightful. This is a very optimistic poem I think, and the rhyme scheme is worthy of salute. \"Frost-gemmed window pane\" applies to my windows this morning. Ah...Robert Service returns to YDP with this charming offering. With the eighteenth century conflating of courage and war, what a welcome poem. The intricate rhyme scheme is worth close study. And so he did! I enjoyed this poetic affirmation of of the out-of-season apple blossom. I especially like Stanza 4. This one's much sweeter than most of the Robert Service poems I've read. He had a delightful sense of humor that some would call macabre. The last four lines of this poem could well apply to most of the men he chose as subjects."}

Rescue by the Royal Navy is prevented by two massive radar-directed superguns on the nearby island of Navarone. When aerial bombing efforts fail, Allied Intelligence gathers a team of commandos to infiltrate Navarone and destroy the guns. Led by Major Roy Franklin (Anthony Quayle), the team is composed of Captain Keith Mallory (Gregory Peck), a renowned spy and mountaineer; Colonel Andrea Stavrou (Anthony Quinn) from the defeated Greek army; Franklin's best friend Corporal Miller (David Niven), an explosives expert and former chemistry teacher; Greco-American Spyros Pappadimos (James Darren), a native of Navarone; and \"Butcher\" Brown (Stanley Baker), an engineer and expert knife fighter.Disguised as Greek fishermen on a decrepit fishing vessel, they sail across the Aegean Sea, where they successfully kill the crew of a German patrol boat coming aboard to inspect them. Later in the voyage Mallory confides to Franklin that Stavrou had sworn to kill him after the war, because Mallory was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Stavrou's wife and children. The team shipwreck on Navarone's coast during a storm; Mallory leads the climb up the cliff, but Franklin badly injures his leg; the injury later becomes infected with gangrene. While taking shelter in the mountains, Mallory stops Franklin from committing suicide and then lies to him: that their mission has been cancelled and that a major naval attack will be mounted on the Navarone coast, away from the gun emplacements. They rendezvous with local resistance fighters: Spyros' sister Maria (Irene Papas) and her friend Anna (Gia Scala), who was once captured and tortured by the Germans before escaping; the trauma rendering her mute.The mission is continually dogged by German soldiers, and the group is eventually captured in the town of Mandrakos while trying to find a doctor for Franklin. Stavrou pretends to grovel as they're being interrogated, which distracts the Germans enough for the group to overpower their captors. They escape in German uniforms, but leave Franklin behind to receive medical attention. In due course, Franklin is injected with scopolamine and gives up Mallory's misinformation, as Mallory had hoped: the fort is emptied in preparation for the supposed attack. Upon infiltrating Navarone, however, Miller discovers most of his explosives have been sabotaged and deduces that Anna is the culprit; she is forced to confess that she is not mute after all, and that the Germans recruited her as an informer in exchange for her release. Mallory reluctantly prepares to execute Anna as punishment, but Maria shoots her instead.The team splits up: Mallory and Miller go for the guns; Stavrou and Spyros create distractions in town, assisted by brave local residents; Maria and Brown steal a boat for their escape. Spyros dies in a stand-off with a German officer, and Brown from knife wounds inflicted during the boat theft. Meanwhile, Mallory and Miller infiltrate the gun emplacement, but set off an alarm when they seal the doors behind them. Mallory and Miller proceed further towards the battery, where Miller then plants explosives on the guns and hides more below an ammunition hoist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a trigger device set into the hoist's wheels. The Germans eventually gain entry into the gun cave, but Mallory and Miller make their escape by diving into the sea, reaching the stolen boat. A wounded Stavrou is helped aboard by Mallory, thus voiding the blood feud between them.The Allied destroyers appear on schedule, but the Germans find the explosives planted on the guns and begin to fire on the passing Allied flotilla. The hoist eventually descends low enough to trigger the hidden explosives, which sets off the surrounding shells into destroying the guns and the fort. Mallory's team safely reaches the British convoy, but Stavrou decides to return to Navarone with Maria, with whom he has fallen in love. Mallory and Miller, returning home, observe the aftermath of their success from a destroyer.\nOutput:"}

{"prompt": "Given the text: There are many advantages to online affiliate marketing programs. One advantage is that your visitors are already online and they have the potential to shop online. Each year, more and more people are increasing the amount of money that they spend online. Online shopping provides the convenience of purchasing goods without ever having to leave your home.\nCustomers now feel at ease entering their credit card number or bank account number into a website due to increased online security. In order for anyone selling items online to tap into this market, they need to provide the exact products and security that visitors are looking for.\nIf you only sell one product on your website, visitors most likely will not return to your website unless they are only looking for the item that you are offering. Also, if the item that you are selling does not need to be replaced often, you are more likely to make fewer sales. You can increase your sales by offering a variety of more products. However, some website owners may feel that is too difficult to come up more of their own products to sell. An alternative to this is to become affiliated with other online stores and begin selling their products in order to earn a commission.\nWhen you are choosing which affiliate products you would like to promote, it is essential that you choose products that are related to your primary business. If customers are visiting your site looking for a specific product, seeing a related item might entice them to purchase more.\nIf a customer purchases anything from your affiliate link, you will receive a commission. This will help you increase profits. You should search for affiliate programs that are both relevant and contain an acceptable pay structure. Remember, a high pay structure is meaningless if you are not able to make any sales with the product.\nThis entry was posted on Monday, May 7th, 2018 at 2:03 am\tand is filed under Cars.

{"prompt": "Given the text: Best known for his research on concepts and categorization, Doug Medin studies how our ideas of the natural world develop, examining biological thought from a cross-cultural perspective He also investigates the role of culture and moral values in the decision-making process.\nThrough a collaboration with researchers on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin and the American Indian Center in Chicago, Medin has explored the scientific reasoning orientations of children across cultures, as well as across urban versus rural populations. This research aims to develop workable interventions to improve students\u2019 understanding of science in the classroom. Medin and his colleagues pursue the idea that \u201cframework theories\u201d relevant in school and in Native American students\u2019 home lives often are clashing. He says student performance would improve if teachers presented in a manner similar to the way students learn and practice community values.\nMedin has been a model and a strong advocate for interdisciplinary research. Many years ago, he and University of Michigan cognitive anthropologist Scott Atran decided to combine their research interests in human behavior and the environment, and today are co-directors of Northwestern\u2019s Cognitive Studies of the Environment program. In one of their many ongoing collaborations, Medin, Atran, and their colleagues have tackled what\u2019s known as commons behavior. This line of inquiry asks why certain populations don\u2019t destroy a shared environment to fulfill selfish needs. By working with ecologists, biologists, and linguists, in addition to psychologists and anthropologists, Medin and Atran have studied Maya populations and their land and found that even without these perceived cultural necessities this group collectively uses the commons without draining its resources. Part of the reason for this behavior, the researchers have found over the years, is rich understanding of forest ecology and seeing the forest spirits as guardians of the forest.\nMedin\u2019s work has helped move psychological science beyond simplistic laboratory models on how the mind operates to a broader focus on how our expertise and cultural background influence our mental view of the world.\nIn what ways has Doug Medin's work impacted the field of psychological science and its approach to understanding how cultural backgrounds influence our mental perception of the world?"}

{"prompt": "Q: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \"the answer.\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Sasse was joined Monday by two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Question: Who said he believes Gonzalo Curiel? === The answer to the above question is\nA:"}

This is viewed as beneficial throughout the onboarding process and beyond into the characteristics of a functional employee more generally.[13][14]\n\nFeedback seeking is similar to information seeking, but refers to new employee efforts to gauge how to behave in their new organization. A new employee may ask co-workers or superiors for feedback on how well he or she is performing certain job tasks or whether certain behaviors are appropriate in the social and political context of the organization. In seeking constructive criticism about their actions, new employees learn what kinds of behaviors are expected, accepted, or frowned upon within the company or work group.[15] Instances of feedback inquiry vary across cultural contexts such that individuals high in self-assertiveness and cultures low in power distance report more feedback seeking than newcomers in cultures where self-assertiveness is low and power distance is high.[16]\n\nAlso called networking, relationship building involves an employee's efforts to develop camaraderie with co-workers and even supervisors. This can be achieved informally through simply talking to their new peers during a coffee break or through more formal means such as taking part in pre-arranged company events."}

They have access to basic tools to do job tasks, but have not yet gotten many weapons or armor, this is an early civilization starting from scratch.\n\nAt the start of the game, they are placed in an environment full of wildlife - some of it is hostile and difficult to kill alone, like packs of wolves and giant bears. Others are docile, like rabbits and deer. There are also trees, berries, stones, and a river stream. Other factions exist but are very distant - the Orcs will be planning on how to face them in the future and upgrading their capabilities in response. The technology tree of our game is similar to Civilization, and our Orc faction has started with Mining and Bronze Working, giving them a benefit in establishing early weapons and armor.\n\nWrite me a brief user story of 5-7 sentences about how the Orc faction navigates the early technology tree, survival sandbox gameplay, and works together as a team.

They worked very well for me and I may order another. But before you rush to purchase one, you should clearly understand a few things.ONE: You have to hit the keys HARD. VERY HARD. These keyboards turned me into a very loud typist when using a more standard keyboard. On the other hand, these keyboards themselves are very quiet even when you are pounding away.TWO: I am a very poor typist. I have lousy technique and make a lot of errors. I suspect that one of the reasons why I like soft keyboards is that they force me to slow down and thus make fewer errors. I suspect that a great typist would not like a soft board.THREE: Yes you can wash these things with soap and water, but they still wear-out just like any keyboard.Where these devices excel is in a very dirty or wet environment and in healthcare setting where they can be sterilized quickly and easily.

She was not under oath when she was interviewed and had attorneys present.\nGiuliani\u2019s concerns about Trump being accused of perjury during an interview echoed those the president expressed on Twitter on Wednesday.\nIn a tweet, Trump called an investigation of possible obstruction of justice a \u201csetup & trap,\u201d once again asserting that there was no wrongdoing to be uncovered in the special counsel inquiry.\nTrump has said previously that he would be willing to have a face-to-face meeting with Mueller or his team, but more recently he has wavered on the prospect. Some of Trump\u2019s advisers have counseled that he could risk being accused of perjury if he submits to open-ended questioning from Mueller and provides meandering answers.\nDuring his television appearances Thursday, Giuliani said he feared that Mueller\u2019s team would be more inclined to believe contradictory testimony from James B. Comey, the FBI director whom Trump fired last year.\nAmong other things, Comey has said Trump asked him to be lenient while investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn, who was forced to resign less than a month into Trump\u2019s presidency, pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia\u2019s then-ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.\nGiuliani said Comey was a \u201cdisgraceful liar,\u201d adding that \u201cthey should put him in the same jail cell\u201d as Martha Stewart, the businesswoman and television personality. As the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Comey prosecuted Stewart in 2003 for making false statements to federal investigators, among other charges, related to a stock trading case. Stewart served five months in federal prison and was released in March 2005.\nGiuliani also said Thursday that he did not know how the New York Times obtained questions that the paper said Mueller wants to ask Trump in an interview.\nThe Times reported that the questions were relayed from Mueller\u2019s team to Trump\u2019s attorneys as part of negotiations over the terms of a potential interview with the president. The list was then provided to the Times by a person outside Trump\u2019s legal team, the paper said.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you summarize Rudolph W. Giuliani's comments about the Mueller investigation and his concerns about President Trump's potential interview with Mueller?"}

{"prompt": "Detailed Instructions: You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\nProblem: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.\nGrady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.\nDuring a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.\nMeanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Terry is there to see if Grady has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a transvestite whom he met on the flight, called Antonia \"Tony\" Sloviak (Michael Cavadias). The pair apparently become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but, immediately afterwards, Terry meets James and becomes infatuated with him, and Tony is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Terry and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two spending an intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms.\nTired and confused, Grady phones Walter and reveals to him that he is in love with Sara. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and James. The following morning the Pittsburgh Police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. The car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and, over the weekend, Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Over the course of his travel around town, a man claiming to be the car's real owner repeatedly accosted Grady. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife, Oola, in the passenger seat, with the stolen memorabilia.\nGrady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells Oola the story behind the memorabilia and allows her to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James's future, Terry convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book, \"a critical exploration of the union of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American mythopoetics\", tentatively titled The Last American Marriage.\nThe film ends with Grady recounting the eventual fate of the main characters   Hannah graduates and becomes a magazine editor; James was not expelled, but drops out and moves to New York to rework his novel for publication; and Terry Crabtree \"goes right on being Crabtree.\" Grady finishes typing his new book (now using a computer rather than a typewriter), which is an account of the events of the film, then watches Sara and their child arriving home before turning back to the computer and clicking \"Save.\"\nSolution:"}

If your U, I, and O keys have 4, 5, and 6 printed in the lower corner, you have an older laptop with an alternate numeric pad. See the next section for details on using it. The ThinkPad line of laptops do not use an alternate numeric pad. You'll need to use the method in this section as a workaround. Some larger models have a dedicated numeric pad. Click the \"Start\" button in the lower-right corner of the desktop. In many versions of Windows, this is just a Windows icon. The Start menu will appear above the button. If you are using Windows 8 and don't see the Start button, press \u229e Win on the keyboard. This will open the Start screen. You can start typing immediately when the Start menu or screen is open to begin searching. You'll see \"On-Screen Keyboard\" in the search results. If your Lenovo laptop does not have a NumLock key, you can use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard to access the numeric pad. The On-Screen Keyboard will open in a new window.

Click the keys in the on-screen numeric keypad to enter numbers.\n\nINPUT ARTICLE: Article: Find someone that you can talk to at any time of night\u2014even 2:30 a.m. This might be your significant other, a sibling, a parent, or your best friend. Roll over and shake your loved one awake, or make a phone call to someone who is willing to talk to you. Maybe, you can connect with your roommate who's only a few doors down. Just reach out to someone if you can.  If it\u2019s not too late, consider calling someone who would really appreciate hearing from you, like an elderly relative. This will not only lift your spirits, but theirs also, which will then lift yours again in return! When loneliness hits in the middle of the night and it\u2019s too late to call or visit with someone, you can always write an e-mail or a letter to someone special. Though you\u2019re probably used to immediate connection in today\u2019s fast-paced society, writing to a loved one in this situation is actually a really great way to thoughtfully convey your feelings and ideas\u2014and the e-mail or letter will reach them in due time. You can also invite people over to watch a movie, have dinner, or just hang out. If you\u2019re seeing close friends or family, invite them to stay over; sometimes it\u2019s nice just knowing there\u2019s someone in the other room. One way to avoid nighttime loneliness is to get out of the house in the evenings leading up to bedtime. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay out until the sun comes up. Simply go out to the movies with friends, have a late dinner with a classmate, or catch drinks with girls from the office.  You may not feel like going out if you feel depressed or sad, but that\u2019s exactly when you most need to do so. Plus, once you get home, it will be time to climb under the covers and you won\u2019t have much time to spend feeling lonely. If you\u2019re really reluctant to go out, try this: instead of committing to the whole evening, tell your friend/the group that you can meet for one drink (or an appetizer, etc.), but then you\u2019ll probably have to get going. Then, you\u2019ll most likely find that things have gone well and you feel much better than you anticipated\u2014and you can stay for another round (or two). Adding an activity/class that you look forward to in the evening can take your mind off your feelings of loneliness and give your evenings a sense of structure. Although you might not find many groups that meet at 2 a.m., you can find a host of activities to engage in during the evening hours, such as yoga, tai chi, knitting, and painting. Look on meetup.com to find people in your area who are interested in similar things and events that are going on around you. Who knows, you might meet someone who has trouble with feeling lonely at night, too. The two of you can spend time together, talk on the phone, or Skype to combat loneliness together. When we\u2019re feeling down, it\u2019s easy to focus all of our attention and energy on ourselves, which can lead to increased negativity. If we focus our attention outwards instead, we can often take our minds off our own loneliness and do some good in the meantime.  Try volunteering at a local homeless shelter, animal shelter, or another place of need in your area. The hours will fly by as you play with or wash the cute pets, or participate in some other charitable event. Consider visiting the elderly and sick at a nursing home or a local hospital. If your own relatives are shut-in, pay them a visit and see what joy it brings. Sometimes, when you get the opportunity to recognize how fortunate you are, life feels less bleak. Being able to help others can really uplift your perspective.\n\nSUMMARY:"}

{"prompt": "Can a group that calculates its regulatory capital requirement on the basis of consolidated or combined financial statements take into account specific parameters approved for individual institutions? If not, what must the group do if it wishes to use specific parameters?: When calculating their regulatory capital requirement, insurance institutions and groups may, in certain cases, use parameters specific to them in place of the parameters in the standard formula. These are commonly known as undertaking-specific parameters (USPs), or group-specific parameters (GSPs) when applied at group level to calculate the capital requirement on a combined or consolidated basis.\nThe parameters that can be personalised in this way are laid down in regulations; they relate solely to the calculation of certain underwriting risks, at the segmentation level that includes, for each relevant business line, direct business, and accepted proportionately.\nThe use by an insurance institution or group of specific parameters for calculating the capital requirement is subject to prior authorisation by the ACPR.\nThe use of specific parameters is defined, for institutions and groups respectively, in point V of Article R.352-5 and in the ninth paragraph of point II of Article R.356-19 of the Insurance Code, applicable to institutions and groups covered by each of the three codes, which transpose Article 104 (7) of Directive 2009/138/EC, known as \u201cSolvency II\u201d. These provisions are supplemented by Articles 218 to 220 and Annex XVII, as well as Article 338 for groups, of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, known as \u201cLevel 2\u201d.\nFinally, the content of the application and the various stages in the approval procedure are laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/498 establishing Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) regarding the procedures to be used by supervisory authorities to approve the use of undertaking-specific and group-specific parameters.\nThe minimum content of the application is defined in Article 1 of the aforementioned implementing regulation.\nThe ACPR will reach its authorisation decision on the full or partial use of specific parameters within a maximum of six months from receipt of the completed application.\nThe use of specific parameters for calculating solvency at individual level by an institution and on a consolidated or combined basis by a group are two distinct and independent measures from an administrative perspective.\nA group that calculates its regulatory capital requirement on the basis of consolidated or combined financial statements cannot take into account any specific parameters approved for individual institutions. If the group wishes also to use specific parameters, it must seek prior authorisation from the ACPR, taking into account the risk profile of the entire group, under the same procedure as that used for individual institutions.\nSimilarly, the authorisation of a group to use group-specific parameters to calculate its adjusted solvency does not constitute authorisation for the group\u2019s individual member institutions."}

Their work provided support solely managed by a group of volunteers (Alcona Historical Society) who have dreamt that such an effort would happen to this historic attraction.\nWe came to the U.P and conquered many tasks that laid before us at this historic state park. Our volunteers sided a building, painted the superintendent's quarters, cleared brush, prepped the historic hotel for plastering, just to name a few. The results were amazing!

{"prompt": "In this task, you are given two questions about a domain. Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the new question, this keyword should also be used the same way. Do not write unnatural questions. (i.e., would not be a question someone might normally ask about domains). Do not write open-ended or subjective questions. (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.) If you couldn't find the answer to your question from a single Google search, try to write a different question. You do not have to stick with the original question word for word, but you should try to create a question that combines the main subjects of the question.\n\nLet me give you an example: What college did this president attend? Where did this president meet his wife?\nThe answer to this example can be: Did this president meet his wife in college?\nHere is why: This is a good question.

{"prompt": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to write an incorrect answer to the given question. Along with the question, you are also given the correct answer(s) and the associated paragraph. An incorrect answer should be closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question but will not truthfully answer the question. Your incorrect answers should be similar to the given correct answer such that it will pose a challenge for students to distinguish the two. A good incorrect answer should prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question. The incorrect answer should not be trivial, in the sense that they should not be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Paragraph- Sent 1: It was hot that day.\nSent 2: The temperature on the wall of the backyard was showing something well over 100 F.\nSent 3: Meanwhile Tom, at home, was trying finish the remainder of carrots from last night, and packing for his trip to Chicago tomorrow.\nSent 4: As employees of the Art Museum, Tom and his older cousin often had to travel to Chicago. Question: What was the temperature outside, when Tom was eating carrots? Correct Answer: well over 100 F.\nSolution: Not very hot.\nExplanation: This is a good incorrect answer, as most of the the words of this answer appear in the the paragraph. They are also related to the content of the question (temperature), yet do not answer the question correctly. Consequently, one has to carefully read the paragraph understand that \"not very hot\" does not answer the question.\n\nProblem: Paragraph- Sent 1: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law.\nSent 2: Instead of lunches at Lut\ufffd\ufffdce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens.\nSent 3: Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden.\nSent 4: To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse.\nSent 5: Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab.\nSent 6: A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps?\nSent 7: Hardly.\nSent 8: They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there.\nSent 9: Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post.\nSent 10: Here is how to grapple \"in the service of justice,\" as many of the schools put it, instead.\nSent 11: Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford.\nSent 12: This is not pro bono legal work; it is \"low bono,\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for.\nSent 13: While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible.\nSent 14: \"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May.\nSent 15: \"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\"Sent 16: The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.\nSent 17: (St. Mary's later dropped out.)

Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\" The President reportedly also said,\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration. \n\nQuestion: \"What was the presidents initial response to the efforts to perform a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan?\"\n\nAnswer: \"He wanted to try diplomacy first\"\nAnswer: no\n\nProblem: Have you ever looked closely at a globe? That continents look like a giant jig-saw puzzle. North America looks like it could fit next to Europe. The edge of South America matches Africa. Scientists noticed these same features. It caused them to start asking questions. They wanted to know if these continents were was connected? If so, how can something so large move so far? What could possibly have enough force to move such a giant slab of rock? Is there other evidence that can provide clues to the past positions of continents? How can answering these questions help us? A scientist named Alfred Wegener had these same questions. Wegener look at rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. He noticed they were the same type and age. He thought that the rocks must have formed side by side. He proposed that the rocks then drifted apart. One part went with North America. The other part stayed with Europe. \n\nQuestion: \"What were the same type and age\"\n\nAnswer: \"Rocks\"\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\nQ: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : **TLDR: My ex refused to hang out with her friends instead of me, and sees being alone with the opposite sex as something shady. I consider spending time with friends and the opposite sex to be healthy, and broke it off.**\n\nI have a very close and tactile relationship with my friends that includes hugging and cuddling, and I like to cultivate those friendships by sometimes meeting up with friends one-on-one. I find that people are too closed off from their friends, and I don't want to be the kind of guy who doesn't hug his friends or show emotion. I am very open with my view on this, and I look for partners with a similar view on platonic skinship. \n\nTherefore, I have 3 important criteria for a potential SO:\n\n1. They have friends of their own, with which they spend regular time with.\n2. Some of those friends are members of the opposite sex. I don't trust people who are incapable of having platonic friendships with the opposite sex.\n3. They, at the very least, hug their friends (the friends who want to be hugged, that is.)\n\nRecently, I started dating a girl who went to my dance class. I hadn't really dated outside of my social circle before, so she didn't really know how I acted around them, but I made sure to be open and clear about the way I drew my boundaries, and invited her to most of my outings the following months. She never invited me to hang out with her friends, which I didn't really care about: I figured I'd meet them eventually, but if she wanted her social life to be entirely her own, I was okay with that. It's not like I wanted her to always hang out with me and my friends either.\n\nDuring our time together, she cut off a couple of her male friends, but she explained that they were pretty toxic and that it was for the best, and I reasoned that she knew better.\n\n2 months later, I noticed that she visibly sulked when I made plans with a friend, and I suggested that she do something with her friends. We had been hanging out a lot just the two of us recently, and I figured she missed her friends too.\n\nShe blew up at me, saying that she didn't want to hang out with her friends because she was in a relationship, and that meant that she'd much rather just spend time with me than them. And if I didn't feel the same, then it meant I probably didn't like her. We argued for a while, but after cooling off for a bit, she came back and said that she wasn't going to argue about my friends, but that she felt spending time alone with other people, especially other guys, was an act of betrayal and that she wouldn't do it. \n\nI broke up with her, which she was understandably very upset about, and she expressed this through some very angry text messages that I've deleted. \n\nI'm conflicted. It's not like she tried to cut me off from my own friends, but I just don't feel like I'm compatible with someone that doesn't share my outlook on social life. Am I the asshole for breaking up just because of that?\nA:"}

Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M).

{"prompt": "Currently it is the only reasonable hero that explains how the natural world developed. Unlike others, it is not based on speculations or unsupported claims but on solid evidence. Evidence that can not be ignored. All evidence that has been found points to one explanation. Archeologist have uncovered many fossil records. Through them science has been able to piece together the way in which the natural world developed from early unicellular organisms to the complex species we see today. For example, archeologist have found the remains of many early humanoids. Thanks to these finds, we now know how we looked millions of years ago and how we ritually developed to the modern human, the Homo Sapiens. These finds support the theory of evolution, because this is exactly what it states. Another good example of how the fossil record helps us understand evolution is the evolution of the horse (see appendix I). Due to the large amount of findings, we have an almost complete model of how the horse evolved. SE Even in our own bodies we find evidence of our primitive ancestors. The wisdom teeth we have are useless, but once our ancestors used them for chewing hard objects. Another piece of evidence came about in the 20th century, when DNA was covered. Analyzing DNA, a molecule which keeps an organism\u2019s genetic code, gives scientists new possibilities. They can now compare the DNA of different species to see how they are related. The discovery of DNA once again confirmed evolution. We saw that all organisms are related to each other. For example, humans and chimpanzees have a 96% match in their DNA This also proves another hypothesis, which states that chimps and humans have a common ancestor which lived several million years ago. This makes the two species closely related and is the reason for their similar DNA. The evolutionary theory is often incorrectly interpreted as saying that humans descended from apes. Many counter this by saying apes are still alive, while according to the theory, they should have died and been replaced by humans. As this argument is based on a misinterpretation of the evolutionary theory, it can not be seen as credible and is therefore not being discussed by scientists. Many people who doubt evolution say that it has never been observed. This is in fact not true. Microinstruction, small changes to species, has been observed both in laboratories and in nature. For instance, on the Galapagos islands, here Darwin also did his research, scientists have observed year-to-year evolution of birds. As the food supply changed, birds whose beaks were more suited to the given food survived and reproduced. Here we clearly see natural selection at work. Another observation was conducted in a laboratory. Scientists took a group of bacteria and added a lethal substance. Most bacteria died, but some had immunity. They survived and successfully reproduced. The next day the entire group was immune to the substance. They adapted to the poisonous environment through natural selection. Considering the overwhelming amount of evidence supporting evolution and he nonexistence of evidence against it, one can conclude that it is indeed a valid scientific theory. Could you provide examples of observed instances of microinstruction in both laboratory and natural settings?"}

The first adaptation is found in the \"ghost fish\" species. These fish have developed a unique organ that allows them to sense electrical fields in the water. This adaptation helps them navigate and find prey in the complete darkness of the trench.\n2. The second adaptation is found in the \"angler fish\" species. These fish have evolved a bioluminescent organ that dangles from their heads like a fishing lure. The light attracts prey, making it easier for the angler fish to hunt in the dark.\n3. The third adaptation is found in the \"gulper eel\" species. These fish have an expandable stomach that allows them to swallow prey larger than their own bodies. This adaptation is particularly useful in the deep sea where prey is scarce, allowing the gulper eel to survive on larger meals for longer periods of time.\nCan you identify the three deep-sea fish species and their unique adaptations?"}

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas.

After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \"gold medal\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area. It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogoro, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...\nThe answer is:"}

{"prompt": "How can we leverage Accord.NET library in C# to train and implement the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification, given a dataset of labeled sentences in the categories of sports, politics, and entertainment? In particular, we want to compute the conditional probabilities of each word in a sentence given each category, and subsequently utilize these probabilities to classify a new sentence into one of the three categories. Could you please provide a concise and elegant C# code that accomplishes this task? \nAs a note, we can use the NaiveBayes class to create a Naive Bayes classifier and predict the labels of new observations after fitting the model on the labeled dataset. Additionally, we may use the CountVectorizer class to transform the dataset into a matrix of word counts, which is essential for the model fitting step. Finally, can you demonstrate the classification process using a sample sentence, \"The sports game was exciting,\" and output the predicted label?"}

{"prompt": "Problem: Iran:\n\nIran received access to the Internet in 1993. According to 2014 census, around 40% of the population of Iran are Internet users. Iran ranks 24th among countries by number of Internet users. According to the statistics provided by the web information company of Alexa, Google Search and Yahoo! are the most used search engines in Iran. Over 80% of the users of Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging service, are from Iran. Instagram is the most popular online social networking service in Iran. Direct access to Facebook has been blocked in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, due to organization of the opposition movements on the website; but however, Facebook has around 12 to 17 million users in Iran who are using virtual private networks and proxy servers to access the website. Around 90% of Iran's e-commerce takes place on the Iranian online store of Digikala, which has around 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers. Digikala is the most visited online store in the Middle East, and ranks 4th among the most visited websites in Iran.\n\nWhat percentage of Iran's population were internet users in 2014?\n---\nA: around 40%\n\n\nProblem: Dwight D. Eisenhower:\n\nIn recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to General of the Army, equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle. He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov, his Russian counterpart, and they became good friends.\n\nAlong with Montgomery, with whom did Eisenhower disagree on strategy?\n---\nA: Churchill\n\n\nProblem: Middle Ages:\n\nBesides the schism, the western church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285\u20131314) and the Hospitallers.\n\nHow did Jan Hus die?\n---\nA: burned at the stake\n\n\nProblem: Multiracial American:\n\nOf numerous relationships between male slaveholders, overseers, or master's sons and women slaves, the most notable is likely that of President Thomas Jefferson with his slave Sally Hemings. As noted in the 2012 collaborative Smithsonian-Monticello exhibit, Slavery at Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty, Jefferson, then a widower, took Hemings as his concubine for nearly 40 years. They had six children of record; four Hemings children survived into adulthood, and he freed them all, among the very few slaves he freed. Two were allowed to \"escape\" to the North in 1822, and two were granted freedom by his will upon his death in 1826. Seven-eighths white by ancestry, all four of his Hemings children moved to northern states as adults; three of the four entered the white community, and all their descendants identified as white. Of the descendants of Madison Hemings, who continued to identify as black, some in future generations eventually identified as white and \"married out\", while others continued to identify as African American. It was socially advantageous for the Hemings children to identify as white, in keeping with their appearance and the majority proportion of their ancestry. Although born into slavery, the Hemings children were legally white under Virginia law of the time.\n\nWhat was the name of the Smithsonian-Monticello exhibit that discussed their relationship?\n---\nA:"}

{"prompt": "How can you design a chatbot in Scala that can efficiently handle a range of customer inquiries and simultaneously handle errors, manage context, and support multiple conversational paths? Can you outline a detailed logic flow and provide examples demonstrating how the chatbot would respond with diverse types of content, including text, images, and links? Also, can you include a Scala code example that showcases how the chatbot would handle different scenarios? Please use the following Mark down code to format your response:\n```\n## Chatbot Design in Scala\n### Problem Statement\nOur goal is to design a chatbot that can handle complex customer inquiries while managing multiple conversational paths, handling errors, and managing context. Additionally, the chatbot should be able to respond with various types of content such as text, images, and links. \n### Design Logic Flow\n1. **Intents**: First, we will define the customer intents that the chatbot will need to handle. Each intent will have a set of possible utterances that the chatbot can recognize. \n2. **Entities**: Next, we will define the entities that the chatbot will need to extract from the user's message. These could include things like dates, times, locations, and product names. \n3. **Dialog Management**: The chatbot will need to manage the conversation flow and context. We will use a state machine approach to handle the various conversational paths. \n4. **Response Generation**: Finally, we will generate a response based on the user's message and the current conversation state. The response could include text, images, or links. \n### Example Response Types\n* **Text Response**: \"Thanks for contacting us! How can I assist you today?\" \n* **Image Response**: \"Here's a photo of the product you're interested in.\" \n* **Link Response**: \"You can learn more about our products at www.example.com/products.\" \n### Code Example\nHere's an example of how the chatbot would handle a user's message:\n```scala\n// Code to handle user input and extract entities\nval userInput = \"I'm looking for a hotel in Paris for next weekend\"\nval location = extractLocation(userInput)\nval dateRange = extractDateRange(userInput)\n// Code to manage conversation flow\nval intent = getIntent(userInput)\nif (intent == BOOK_HOTEL) {\n  if (location == null) {\n    // Code to handle error\n    respond(\"I'm sorry, I didn't catch the location you were looking for. Could you please try again?\")\n  } else if (dateRange == null) {\n    // Code to handle error\n    respond(\"I'm sorry, I didn't catch the date range you were looking for. Could you please try again?\")\n  } else {\n    // Code to generate response\n    val hotels = findHotels(location, dateRange)\n    if (hotels.isEmpty) {\n      respond(\"I'm sorry, I couldn't find any hotels that match your search criteria.\")\n    } else {\n      val hotel = selectHotel(hotels)\n      val confirmation = bookHotel(hotel, dateRange)\n      respond(s\"Great! Your hotel booking at ${hotel.name} is confirmed for ${dateRange}. Your confirmation number is ${confirmation}.\")\n    }\n  }\n} else {\n  // Code to handle other intents\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis code demonstrates how the chatbot would handle a user's request to book a hotel in Paris for next weekend. The chatbot extracts the location and date range from the user's message, and then uses a state machine to manage the conversation flow. Finally, the chatbot generates a response based on the user's input and the current conversation state.\n```"}

{"prompt": "Part 1. Definition\nIn this task you are given a disfluent question, a proper question and a context. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing and a proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency. Classify whether the question is answerable or not based on the given context.\nPart 2. Example\nproper question: Who recorded Walking in Fresno? \n disfluent question: Where no sorry who recorded Walking in Fresno? \n context: In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, Walking Into Fresno, written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous WWVA Jamboree radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia. Aken, adopted by Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.\nAnswer: Yes\nExplanation: The input sentence is correctly recognized as answerable or not because the answer to the question is 'Bill Aken' and it is present in the context so it is a positive example.\nPart 3. Exercise\nproper question: What is the Royal Castle the most interesting example of? \n disfluent question: When was um no what is the Royal Castle the most interesting example of? \n context: Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications. The most significant buildings are St. John's Cathedral (14th century), the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style, St. Mary's Church (1411), a town house of Burbach family (14th century), Gunpowder Tower (after 1379) and the Royal Castle Curia Maior (1407\u20131410). The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called The Negro (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632). The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596\u20131619) and the Jesuit Church (1609\u20131626) at Old Town. Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth's Church (1603\u20131639) and Sigismund's Column (1644).\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document. The title should convey the main idea/event/topic about which the document is being written. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link].\nQ: The Daily Wire spoke with Michael Saltsman  the managing director of the Employment Policies Institute (EPI)  for clarification about the study. For background   Saltsman  received degrees in economics and political science from the University of Michigan  and was a field economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from 2006-2009. In addition to his position at EPI   Saltsman  is the vice president of Berman and Company  a public relations firm.\nAccording to  Saltsman   California is an ideal state in which to conduct a study like EPI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because \"there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a tremendous amount of minimum wage activity  both at the state level and then at the local level.\" This didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come without difficulties  however.  Saltsman  noted that the team had to account for the impact of other economic factors on certain industries  like apparel manufacturing  which has been harmed by factors other than rising minimum wages:\n Saltsman  stated that Macpherson and Even \"threw the kitchen sink\" at this issue  running \"models a number of different ways  accounting for different economic factors and trends that might have influenced the kind of employment trends we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing absent a minimum wage.\" Additionally  they looked at data \"county by county \" omitting material they believed was weak or possibly unreliable.\nThose hardest hit by minimum wage increases tend to work for businesses that \"don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a tremendous ability to absorb new labor costs \" according to  Saltsman . Restaurants  for example  tend to have incredibly narrow profit margins  and government-mandated wage hikes force these businesses to cut costs. Unfortunately  cutting costs often means letting go of \"less skilled or less experienced employees \" replacing them with machines  and self-service options.\nThe best thing to do with government-mandated minimum wages   Saltsman  says  is freeze them. That way  the issue would become \"less and less relevant\" to the conversation.\nThere are some who argue that a $15 to $20 an hour wage is necessary for basic survival.  Saltsman  counters this contention with a sobering fact: \"You can either have a $15 minimum wage  or you can have have the same number of jobs you have right now. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have both.\"\n Saltsman  believes in a more targeted approach to helping the working poor:\nA more generous Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  suggests  Saltsman   is one way to help low-wage workers  as \"it has been more effective at reducing poverty than a higher minim wage  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better targeted  and creates an incentive to work.\" Moreover  \"because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targeted through the tax code instead of a mandate on employers  you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get some of the same unintended consequences\" that come with mandatory minimum wage increases.\n Saltsman  also rebutted the progressive argument that businesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both small or franchise-based businesses as well as large corporations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 should absorb the costs of wage increases  saying that such an idea is \"a pretty dramatic misunderstanding of how these businesses work.\"\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some pot of corporate cash that franchise businesses are able to tap into  \" Saltsman  stated  adding that franchisees essentially operate as small businesses:\nWhile larger corporations might be better able to absorb certain costs  profit margins are still relatively narrow  according to  Saltsman . Additionally  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to forget that these companies employ thousands and thousands of people  and face overhead costs.\nRegarding the seemingly excessive pay of company executives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something brought up frequently by progressive activists \u00e2\u0080\u0093  Saltsman  offered a rebuttal:\nIn conclusion  and to further illustrate the speciousness of the minimum wage argument   Saltsman  ran through a common scenario:\nA: "}

{"prompt": "Please read the following email and sum it up in a concise and clear way:\nHello All,\n\nI was asked to look into this topic of Balance and Center Balance matched veneer specifications. I spoke with Ben Castellon and WI and did a deep dive into the NAAWS 4.0. Unfortunately, the NAAWS manual is only slightly more illuminating than the specifications Architects often provide. I\u2019m trying to present what we know here in the shortest and clearest way possible, but I apologize if the delivery is convoluted. The material certainly is \ud83d\ude0a. Here is a brief TLDR summary:\n\nIf a project is specified as Premium Grade in regards to the veneer paneling, then Balance Matching is the default requirement. \n\nBalance matching requires us, is in the least restrictive definition of the term, to order our panels from our supplier as balanced match, and then trim both sides of a Balance Matched panel equally to achieve the final width of the panels. \nThis means the panels need to be laid out and cut on the panel saw, not the CNC = More material waste and shop labor. \n\nA \u201cSequenced\u201d Specification adds a whole new level of complexity and cost to the mix. Unfortunately, WI has four separate definitions for what can constitute \u201cSequence\u201d matching, plus more definitions for the more selective \u201cBlueprint\u201d matching specification. \n\n \n\u201cBalance Matched\u201d panels are defined as such on page 383 of the NAAWS-\n \n \nCenter Balanced is the same as balance matched, with the exception that there is a seam in the center of the panel rather than a flitch.\n \n \n \nReading these two definitions by the letter, you would assume that the outer two leaves on the panels could be any size after edge-trimming. For instance, if you had a balanced panel with 8\u201d veneer leaves, the outermost two leaves could be 2\u201d. This would suggest that we could conform to this specification by ordering panels at full width from the manufacturer, then cutting them down equally from both edges to maintain a balance match. This is potentially a huge waste of material, and a huge increase in labor time as every panel will need to be laid out and cut on the panel saw. Notably, the specification calls for Balance matching being the Default for a Premium Grade wall panel specification, meaning that the specs would have to specifically call for a running match for us to avoid balance matching the panels on a Premium Grade Job. \n \nBen Castellon recommended RFI\u2019ing a Premium Grade veneer spec or a specifically Balanced Match veneer spec during the bid phase, as the increased cost is substantial.\n \nNow, to make it really complicated, let\u2019s add sequencing into the mix:\n \nIf sequenced panels are specified and the project is Premium Grade, they must be balanced match:\nWI States at 8.6.2.1\n \n\nNow it gets trickier. WI allows for several types of Sequencing:\n Pre-Manufactured Sequenced Sets Full Width Panel Utilization\n\u2022 This specification assumes that panels will be delivered and installed at full size, 4x8, 4x10, etc. Balance matched. Edges or \u201cfiller\u201d or \u201cMakeup\u201d panels do not need to be sequenced. Since drawings almost never show full width panels with little fillers at the edges, I would say the Architect\u2019s plans often preclude our ability to sequence this way.\nPre-Manufactured Sequenced Sets Selectively Reduced Panel Utilization\n\u2022 This scenario is the tack we are taking on Menlo Park CC, where we are ordering the panels sequenced at full size, balance matched, and then trimming both edges equally to the specified panel size after field measurement, and installing in sequence."}

{"prompt": "Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. Question: How long did it take to set up thinkofthechildren.co.uk website? Options: - Few years   - Few month   - not enough information   - 10 minutes === The correct answer is\nAnswer:"}

A trio of corrupt cops led by Rydell (Chazz Palminteri), storm in to steal the drugs, money and kill everyone else, but a shootout ensues, resulting in the deaths of two officers.

{"prompt": "Please answer this: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who does Benjamin Button share his last name with?  In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She tells her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and the blind clockmaker, Mr. Gateau, who was hired to make a clock for it. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see the clock running backwards. Mr. Gateau says he made it that way as a memorial, so that the boys they lost in the war, including his own son, could come home again and live full lives. Mr. Gateau was never seen again. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button. On the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. After the baby's mother, Caroline, dies during childbirth, the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. \"Tizzy\" Weathers find the baby, and Queenie decides to raise him as her own, naming him Benjamin. Benjamin learns to walk in 1925, after which he uses crutches in place of a wheelchair. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. He and Daisy become good friends. Later, he accepts work on a tugboat captained by Mike Clark. Benjamin also meets Thomas who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In Autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew; Daisy later is accepted into a dance company in New York City under choreographer George Balanchine.\n++++++++\nAnswer: Thomas Button\n\n\nProblem: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person that Polly Perkins is looking into the disappearance of?  In a technologically-advanced 1939, the zeppelin Hindenburg III moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \"Sky Captain\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and convinces Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture.\n\nA: Jorge\n\n\nQ: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the two individuals who met with members of Comit\u00e9 de Madres Monsignor Romero in El Salvador?  Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met Ren\u00e9 Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'\u00e9tat. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'\u00e9tat that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comit\u00e9 de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning...\nA:"}

{"prompt": "Can you share your experience transitioning from high school teaching to becoming a flight instructor and corporate pilot? Answer according to: You could say I love teaching. After graduating from college with a B.A. degree in English Education, I taught high school for two years before becoming involved in aviation. In 1972 I started flying lessons, which led me to become a Flight Instructor and Corporate Pilot. In 2006, I decided to take the next step and began training pilots in simulators at Flight Safety International, where I worked till I retired in 2013 and went from part-time to full-time Apriori Beauty Consultant.\nFlying for all those years didn't leave me with much money for retirement. I joined Apriori Beauty in 2009 because first of all, I loved the way my skin felt after using the Celloxylin\u00ae Anti-Aging skincare line. I became an Apriori Beauty Independent Consultant shortly after, knowing that I could make money by sharing these products. The great news about the money was it was passive income. I didn't have to trade my hours for dollars like I had with my flying career. When I see another person learn that they no longer have to give up time with their children and family to earn an income, the smile on their face is priceless. In fact, I'm my happiest when I see someone else's life change because of their involvement with me on this fabulous journey.\nOne thing I've learned since becoming a Consultant is that people find me motivational when looking to expand on their own journey with Apriori Beauty. I love sharing what has worked for me, and more importantly, the failures I have experienced. There's always something to learn from each experience you encounter, whether it's positive or negative. I have a tendency to ferret out the problems and do my best to change what I'm doing until it works. The fun is failing until you succeed. It took me a long time to put failure behind me and move on. I enjoy sharing that the success with this business is recognizing the failures for what they are ... the steps that lead to success.\nMy favorite Apriori Beauty product is the Celloxylin\u00ae PSR Next. Once I added the PSR Next to my skincare regimen, I quickly learned how much my skin loved the way the PSR Next made it feel, and ever since then, I've been using it religiously. In addition to using it with the Derma Firm Illuminator, I also use it daily with the Celloxylin\u00ae Firming Complex to give my skin that flawless glow.\nApriori Beauty's co-Founders/Owners, Susan Twellman and Elizabeth Vervynck continuously inspire me by not only putting together this fabulous Company, but also closely working with us Consultants, and helping us in any way they can. Sharon Michaels has been my business coach for a couple years now and she keeps my feet to the fire and calls me out when I lose focus. My advice to others would be to find a company that meets your personal ideal and then hire a business coach who keeps you accountable. When I joined Apriori Beauty, I was a Corporate Jet Pilot. Other women find my choice of career either crazy or terrific. However, no matter how competent I was in the cockpit, I need these three women to keep me on the path that will lead me to the Platinum level I desire."}

{"prompt": "Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?  Handel's music for Messiah  is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint\u2014a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \"Glory to God\", apart from the solo in \"The trumpet shall sound\" they are heard only in \"Hallelujah\" and the final chorus \"Worthy is the Lamb\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\". In  \"Glory to God\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \"quietly, from afar\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance.  In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\"  according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \"an aspiration towards D major\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \"trumpet\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \"ascending fourth\"  as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\" and on numerous other...\n"}

{"prompt": "Write me the beginning of a script (formatted like a real movie script) for a comedy movie scene, based on the below information:\n\nAndy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He has poor personal hygiene and can often be found making moaning noises while using disabled toilets, despite him having no obvious disability. Andy wears an untidy, stained white shirt. When addressing a group he starts with the words \"Right guys, settle down\".\n\nRoger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, because he knows that he is much more qualified than Andy.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he enjoys making people uncomfortable. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his colleagues.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to people in German and they don't understand what she's saying. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances."}

[step] There are a wide variety of christmas trees and include fir, pine, spruce, cypress, and cedar. These trees thrive in different climates and look different from one another. <sep> (A) It is important to research the tree before setting up your tree to try it out to make sure you can write the tree's growing season so that you can get the most supplies you need. If you're just interested in having a tree stand out, then make sure to check for the following : [substeps] Spruce trees. (B) [substeps] Trees green may be used in a mix of green and evergreen. Greens, such as pintos and olive oil, may be more delicate than these. (C) Where the trees grow together is up to you. [substeps] Spruce trees light up the night for hours in the morning and drown out the morning sunrise between afternoons. (D) Think about where your tree forest will be located and choose a tree that can thrive in that climate. [substeps] Balsam firs are a popular christmas tree species that grow in the northern united states and canada, in hardiness zones 3-5 or states like minnesota, north dakota, and montana.\nSolution: D\nReason: This is a good example. Only option D is about Christmas trees.

(C) It may also say something like \" depilatory cream for facial hair. \" [substeps] If you have a hard time removing your mustache without using a facial gel, use a lozenge spray. (D) For more severe cases, choose a plastic or glass depilatory cream that has at least spf 30 or more. Some depilatory cream may take longer, though, due to the fact that it will stick more firmly into the skin.\nStudent:"}

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"The social identity of the children was strongly determined by the tribe's kinship system. Among the matrilineal tribes of the Southeast, the mixed-race children generally were accepted as and identified as Indian, as they gained their social status from their mother's clans and tribes, and often grew up with their mothers and their male relatives. By contrast, among the patrilineal Omaha, for example, the child of a white man and Omaha woman was considered \"white\"; such mixed-race children and their mothers would be protected, but the children could formally belong to the tribe as members only if adopted by a man.\"?\nAns: What were the children part of?\n\nI want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"During the early years, MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals. The time-compressed CLV re-issue of Jaws no longer had the original soundtrack, having had incidental background music replaced for the video disc version due to licensing cost (the music would not be available until the THX LaserDisc box set was released in 1995). One Universal/Columbia co-production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions, The Electric Horseman, is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson's songs. An MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck, sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film. For many years this was the only disc-based release of the film, until widescreen DVD formats were released with extras.

Instead of saying \"he looked like a vampire,\" I'd like to say something like \"he looked [vampiric].\" I actually just found out vampiric was a word, but I want something that sounds better (more colloquial/natural, I suppose) and covers a variety of traits (pale, emaciated, sickly, etc). Why I don't just use \"vampiric\": As @chepner commented: I think the idea is to find a word that isn't so \"circular\", and doesn't refer explicitly to vampires or require knowledge of vampires in context. If someone were to ask \"What does a vampire look like?\", then \"It looks vampiric/vampirish\" wouldn't be terribly helpful. I don't want to explicitly refer to drug addicts as vampires. I just want to capture those traits in the best way. \nAnswer: There is always the tried and true \"strung-out\" or \"cadaverous\" or \"corpselike\" i like \"he had the look of a worn and deflated pillowcase in need of a wash\".\nA:"}

How many fish does Jonah have now?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Since the number of oranges that Martin has now is twice the number of limes, there are 50 / 2 = 25 limes. The number of fruits she has now is 50 oranges + 25 limes = 75. If she had eaten half of the number of fruits that she had, initially Martin had 2 * 75 = 150 fruits.\nThe answer: 150\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: After eating half of the number of fruits he had, Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes.

When you add the marks she scored in physics to the total marks of the other subjects, the full marks become 235 + 40 = 275.\nThe answer: 275\nReverse engineering the question: Teresa scored 70 marks in science, 80 in music, 85 in social studies, and the physics exam, which was the hardest test that Teresa had ever taken in her entire life, she scored half as many marks as she scored in music. Calculate the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects.\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Let A be Matthew\u2019s age. Rebecca is A - 2 years old. Freddy is A + 4 years old. Their ages add up to 35, so A + A - 2 + A + 4 = 3A + 2 = 35. Therefore, 3A = 35 - 2 = 33. Matthew is A = 33 / 3 = 11 years old. Thus, Freddy is 11 + 4 = 15 years old.\nThe answer: 15\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Cynthia has three children whose ages add up to 35. Matthew is two years older than Rebecca and four years younger than Freddy. How many years old is Freddy?\n\n\nBob got 12 * 10 = 120 skips. Jim got 15 * 10 = 150 skips. So in total they got 120 + 150 = 270 skips.\nThe answer: 270\nReverse engineering the question: Bob and Jim decide to skip rocks. Bob can skip a rock 12 times. Jim can skip a rock 15 times. If they each skipped 10 rocks how many total skips did they get?\n\n\nIf the price of a lawnmower was $1800 a year ago, 2 / 5 less than the cost right now, then it now costs 2 / 5 * 1800 = $720 more to buy one lawnmower. The total cost of buying one lawnmower right now is $1800 + $720 = $2520. To purchase 4 such lawnmowers, Mr. Lucian will have to pay $2520 * 4 = $10080.\nThe answer: 10080\nReverse engineering the question:"}

{"prompt": "Teacher: In this task, you will be given a passage to read. A fill in the blank question will be given to you.  Your answer should fit the blank appropriately.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:\nThe music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a  divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game 's opening theme song ,  ( \u3082\u3057\u3082\u541b\u304c\u9858\u3046\u306e\u306a\u3089 , Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May 'n . Its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi , who had worked on May 'n on previous singles . fill in the blank  : The music was composed by Hitoshi __________________ , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games\nSolution: Sakimoto\nReason: This a good example. The actual line from the passage is The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimotos, In the given sentence, it is stated clearly that Sakimoto answers the question correctly.\n\nNow, solve this instance: There 's Got to Be a Way is an R & B @-@ pop music song with elements of gospel . The theme of social activism can be heard in the lyrics  There \u2019 s got to be a way / to connect this world today .  The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world , and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone . Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics  Couldn 't we accept each other / Can 't we make ourselves aware. fill in the blank  :  There 's Got to Be a Way is an R & B @-@ pop music __________________ with elements of gospel . \nStudent:"}

Chosen Company, the\nmechanized infantry company is located with a CO HQ at 11S NU 39000 14000. You begin talking to the distro platoon leader. He lets you know that he takes 4 vehicles to each of\nthe tank companies twice a day and 7 vehicles to the infantry company once a day. Additionally, they also have to pick up supplies from the Brigade Support Area (BSA) once a day and that\nrequires a convoy of 19 vehicles. The BSA is located at 11S NU 51000 11000. It takes 2 soldiers to\noperate each vehicle.\nYou next talk to your BN intelligence officer (S2) who informs you that in this desert terrain, 10\nkm/hr is an average speed. The roads are significantly damaged and also have a average speed of\n10 km/hr. She also lets you know that there is a threat from enemy indirect fire that gets bigger\nas you place the CTCP closer to the front lines. To reduce this risk, the CTCP will need to be\ncamouflaged. Her best approximation is that it takes C(d) = 15.1 \u2212 1.1d hours worth of work\nto camouflage the CTCP each day to reduce the threat of indirect fire to the CTCP. Where C is\nsoldier hours of labor per day to camouflage the CTCP and d is distance from the CTCP to the\nFLoT in kilometers. Because the convoys are moving, they are not at risk of being engaged by\nindirect fire."}

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nPart 2. Example\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a self-taught, genius-level intellect, though he works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Billy (Cole Hauser) and Morgan (Casey Affleck). When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) posts a difficult mathematics problem as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the graduate students and Lambeau himself. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Lambeau chances upon Will solving the problem but Will flees the scene. That night at a bar, Will meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student about to graduate from Harvard, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford and gives Will her phone number before leaving.\nAnswer: How old is Will Hunting in the movie ?\nExplanation: This is a good question which has a factoid answer.\nPart 3. Exercise\nDr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a biotechnology summit. At the hotel, Martin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it. On the way, the taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the Spree, knocking Martin unconscious. The driver, Gina (Diane Kruger), rescues him and flees the scene, as she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. Martin regains consciousness at a hospital after having been in a coma for four days.When Martin returns to the hotel, he discovers Liz with another man, and she claims to not know him. Martin phones a colleague in the States, Prof. Rodney Cole (Frank Langella) but reaches only his voice mail. Aboard a train, Martin writes down his schedule for the next day by memory. Martin visits the office of Prof. Leo Bressler (Sebastian Koch), whom he is scheduled to meet, but sees the impostor, \"Martin B\" (Aidan Quinn), already there. As Martin attempts to prove his identity, Martin B shows him his ID and family photo, both of which have the impostor's face. Overwhelmed by the identity crisis, Martin falls unconscious, then finds himself back at the hospital. Smith (Olivier Schneider\u00c2\u00a0(fr)), an assassin sent to target Martin, kills a nurse, Gretchen Erfurt (Eva L\u00c3\u00b6bau), but Martin escapes.He seeks help from Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former Stasi agent Ernst J\u00c3\u00bcrgen (Bruno Ganz). Martin's only clues are his father's book on Botany and Gina, who since the crash now works at a diner. While Martin persuades Gina to help him, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen digs up information related to Martin and the biotechnology summit. He discovers the summit will be attended by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada) of Saudi Arabia, who is funding a secret project headed by Bressler. Prince Shada has survived numerous assassination attempts by extremists in his own country, and J\u00c3\u00bcrgen suspects that Martin's identity theft may be part of another attempt.At Gina's apartment, Smith and another terrorist, Jones (Stipe Erceg), attack; the couple escapes after Gina kills Smith. In his book, Martin finds that Liz has written a series of numbers that correspond to words found specific pages. Using his schedule, Martin confronts Liz alone; she tells him he left his briefcase at the airport. Meanwhile, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen receives Cole at his office and deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and potent killer. Realizing Cole is there to kill him and he has no way of escaping, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen commits suicide by ingesting cyanide to protect Martin.After retrieving his briefcase, Martin parts ways with Gina. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxicab and chases them. When Martin wakes, Cole says Martin Harris is a cover name in an assassin team including Liz to target the summit. Liz notified Cole that Martin injured his head during the car crash altering his memory and causing him to believe his false Martin Harris persona was his own identity. Cole explains, that's why Martin B was activated as his replacement. Gina runs over Jones before he can kill Martin, then rams Cole's van, killing him. After Martin finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, he remembers that he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in the suite to be occupied by Prince Shada.Now aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. He heads to the hotel with Gina. Security immediately arrests them, but Martin convinces them of his presence in the hotel three months earlier. Liz uses her own copy of the book's secret codes to remotely access Bressler's laptop and steal the data. After being convinced of the bomb's presence, security evacuates the hotel.Martin suddenly realizes that Prince Shada is not the target, but Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. With Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Seeing their assassination attempt has been foiled, Liz dies attempting to disarm the bomb. Martin kills Martin B, the last remaining terrorist, before the latter can murder Bressler. Bressler announces that he is giving his project to the world for free, while Martin and Gina board a train with new passports and identities.\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "Q:There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Question: What is most likely Chan's family's social status? Options:  A. Upper middle-class  B. Poor  C. not enough information  D. Very wealthy  === The correct answer is\nA:"}

It is the only such consolidation in California. The mayor is also the county executive, and the county Board of Supervisors acts as the city council. The government of San Francisco is a charter city and is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service. The 11-member Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a president and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of direct ballot initiatives to pass legislation. The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city. Upon the death or resignation of mayor, the President of the Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board elects an interim replacement for the remainder of the term. In 1978, Dianne Feinstein assumed the office following the assassination of George Moscone and was later selected by the board to finish the term. In 2011, Edwin M. Lee was selected by the board to finish the term of Gavin Newsom, who resigned to take office as Lieutenant Governor of California. Lee (who won 2 elections to remain mayor) was temporarily replaced by San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed after he died on December 12, 2017.

{"prompt": "Answer this question please:\nPassage: Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 13th -- 9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.\n\nQuestion: Based on this passage, when did the ancient greece civilization start and end?\n\nStream of random thoughts: The important part for answering this question is: Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 13th -- 9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD)....

Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are different parts of a process known as either glacial isostasy, glacial isostatic adjustment, or glacioisostasy. Glacioisostasy is the solid Earth deformation associated with changes in ice mass distribution. The most obvious and direct effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica.

{"prompt": "The operation is designed to generate an artificial crater in the asteroid Ryugu, which the probe has been studying since June 2018.\nHayabusa-2 will later descend into the crater to collect pristine samples of the asteroid that have not been exposed to the harsh environment of space.\nThe charge is carried on the Small Carry-On Impactor (SCI) device.\nThis is a 14kg conical container attached to Hayabusa-2 and packed with plastic explosive.\nThe SCI is due to separate from Hayabusa-2 at 01:56 GMT on Friday at an altitude of 500m above the surface of Ryugu. That will kick off a 40-minute countdown to detonation. When the device explodes, it is expected to punch a 10m-wide hole in the asteroid.\nIn the meantime, Hayabusa-2 should have manoeuvred itself to hide away on the other side of the asteroid, shielding the spacecraft from any flying debris.\nOn the way, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) probe will deploy a small camera, called DCAM3. The camera will observe the explosion from a distance of about 1km and transmit images back to its \"mothership\".\nYuichi Tsuda, the mission's project manager, explained: \"We expect the impact accuracy [of the SCI] to be something like a 200m radius, it's very large... we expect to have a hole somewhere in that very big region.\n\"We will try to find that artificial crater two weeks later, by descending to a lower altitude and making extensive observations.\"\nRyugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of space rock known as a C-type asteroid. It's a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System.\nBut bombardment with cosmic radiation over the aeons is thought to alter the surfaces of these planetary building blocks. So, scientists want to get at a fresh sample that hasn't been changed by this process.\n\"Second somewhere that's as feasible as possible in terms of landing... if those two don't meet together, we go with the first priority.\"\nCan you summarize the purpose of the Hayabusa-2 mission and the upcoming operation to generate an artificial crater on the asteroid Ryugu?"}
{"prompt": "Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them. The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random.\n\nExample input: Concept: alligator, Relatum: lizard.\nExample output: coord\nExample explanation: Alligator and lizard belong to the same semantic class of reptiles, so the relation is coordinate.\nQ: Concept: shovel, Relatum: old.\nA:"}

{"prompt": "Teacher:Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Three locations have been put forward as possible sites for the new road crossing. Option A is the site of the existing Dartford to Thurrock crossing, option B would connect the A2 with the A1089, while option C would join the M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Essex. It is claimed it could create 6,000 jobs and boost the local economy but groups opposing the plans fear the scheme would damage green belt and destroy local villages. Six panellists discussed the issues surrounding the crossing during a BBC Radio Kent and BBC Essex debate on 8 July. A summary of the points they planned to raise are reproduced below. David Burch, Essex Chambers of Commerce \"A crossing is most definitely needed. The cost to Essex business is extreme and congestion is a real problem. Doing nothing is not an option and Essex needs to lead the way with important transport links. \"Members are continually having to deal with late deliveries, extra fuel costs, tolls and if we do nothing Essex will lose out on inward development and investment. \"London Gateway is also going to cause more traffic problems. We must have a new crossing.\" Paul Carter, Conservative Leader of Kent County Council \"A third crossing is essentially needed. The growth projections for the Thames Gateway will create hundreds of thousands of new homes and hopefully hundreds of thousands of new jobs. \"We have to have a competitive economy and commerce has to get from A to B.\" Natalie Chapman, the Freight Transport Association \"We have discussed the options available extensively with our members and option C - linking the M2 in Kent with the M25 between junctions 29 and 30 - seems to be a clear contender. It would provide a much shorter and more direct route for lorries travelling up from the Channel ports and East Kent to the Midlands and beyond. \"This would lead to extensive savings in fuel and drivers' hours as well as reducing emissions from freight. However, it is by far the most expensive option to construct, so we are concerned that it may lead to potentially high tolls - which, if set at too high a level, could erode any time and fuel cost savings.\" John Kent, Labour Leader of Thurrock Borough Council \"We don't want or need another crossing in Thurrock. Speed up free-flow tolls and speed up investment on Junction 30. We need this now, not in five or 10 years' time.\" Richard Knox-Johnston, CPRE Protect Kent \"The consultation process should be delayed until after the impacts of high-speed tolling have been fully assessed, the junction improvements either side of the crossing have been implemented, the rail charges for freight through the Channel Tunnel have been reviewed and reduced, the full effects of the opening of London Gateway have been assessed and the subsidies for road transport have been calculated together with the new vignette on foreign vehicles. \"We believe there is, at present, no comprehensive and fully analysed case for a new Lower Thames Crossing which would have a major deleterious environmental impact on the area.\" Mike Stephens, Institution of Civil Engineers \"Free-flow tolling may provide a short term solution to the congestion at the toll booths but will not provide a medium or long-term solution to the congestion at the crossing as the bridge and tunnels act as filters for traffic. \"The three solutions suggested each provide different answers and challenges but any of the three would provide a medium to long term benefit. \"The key issue is that delaying a decision is putting off the inevitable - a decision needs to be taken and a new crossing provided as soon as practicable to meet existing and future demand.\"\nStudent:"}

It feels nice to disturb you, so I\u2019m disturbing you; it feels nice to love you, so love you dear.\nBetween the thousand yesterdays and a million tomorrows, there\u2019s only one today and I wouldn\u2019t let this day pass without saying this to you \u2013 I love you.\nUr eyes dark like a castle moat at night. Lower drawbridge, my queen, and let me cross.\nYou look even more beautiful without make up.\nYou are the reason that I am smart, you are the person who stole my heart, my life is short and you are the part, I love you, I love you with true heart!\nThere are lots of birds murmuring only about you. You should at least once listen to the birds; only then you\u2019ll come to know how much I love you.\nYou make me complete. I love you so much, I didn\u2019t know what love meant until I met you.\nEverything you ever heard and read about love can only be experienced when you will meet your love and that will be the best phase of your life.\nMy eyes search for you when you are not around. My heart aches when I don\u2019t find you. You are the reason for all my happiness and without you my life would be so dull. All I want in my life is that we stay together for all the life. I love you.\nMoney, material possession, power would look meaningless when you start experiencing the intensity of love.\nYou are like the sunshine so warm, you are like sugar, so sweet, you are like you and that is the reason why I love you!\nThe first thing I imagined when I saw the word Love is you.\nI love you with the breath, the smiles and the tears of all my life.\nEvery definition of love will start and being with your partner, there is nothing other you can imagine of.\nTrue love is about loving someone completely with all your will and heart.\nDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late to tell someone how much you love, how much you care.Because when they\u2019re gone, no matter how loud you shout and cry, they won\u2019t hear you anymore."}

Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them.

Answer with \"Yes\" or \"No\".\nQ: One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a $250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services. <sep>Who crafted a law practice catering to working-class families who are mostly Latino?<sep>Fred Rooney\nA: "}

{"prompt": "In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nExample: Context word: fit.\nExample solution: Sentence 1: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too large. \nAnswer1: trophy. \nSentence 2: The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because _ is too small. \nAnswer2: suitcase.\nExample explanation: Here, the two objects are \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". The trigger words are \"large\" and \"small\". Everything else (apart from the trigger words) are the same in the two sentences. The two sentences have different answers, which are the two objects (\"trophy\" and \"suitcase\").\n\nProblem: Context Word: lump.\n"}

Soon a girl is found mauled to death, and Manning and Kiki feel remorse for having unleashed the monster. After attending the girl's funeral, Manning joins a posse that seeks to hunt down the giant cat. Presently another young woman is killed, and Manning begins to suspect that the latest killing is the work of a man who has made the death look like a leopard attack. The leopard's owner, who admits to spells of drunkenness, is unnerved by Manning's theory and begins to doubt his own sanity. He asks the police to lock him up, but while he is in jail another killing occurs: the victim this time is Clo-Clo. Afterward, the leopard is found dead in the countryside, and is judged to have died before at least one of the recent killings.

Lawrence Hammer and Dean Mazzoli are two Naval Officers undergoing the rigorous and demanding Navy BUD/s training program. Both men quest to become Navy SEALs. During the training Hammer is shown as cocky and not a true team player. Mazzoli is a natural leader who is respected by the other trainees. The two men clash over time due to Hammer's attitude making a bad name for everyone. The two men's feud eventually is seen by the training instructs and after being punished in a \"military manner\" the two become friends. On liberty Mazzoli takes an interest in Barbara, a known love interest and friend of Hammer's. Barbara and Mazzoli share a romantic moment under a capsized canoe but Mazzoli breaks away before anything further happens knowing that his friend Hammer has been \"with\" her for a while. Later that night Hammer and Barbara elope and Mazzoli is shocked but accepts the marriage. The two finish their BUD/s training and Mazzoli informs Hammer that he is completing his SDV training on the East Coast, not the West Coast as Hammer will be doing. A brief confrontation between the two occurs on the beach and subsides when Mazzoli says it is because of Barbara. Soon Iraq invades Kuwait and Hammer is seen on a reconnaissance mission with Bosco, who was Mazzoli's and Hammer's former lead training instructor. After coming under enemy fire Bosco is taken prisoner. Hammer and Mazzoli reunite when Mazzoli comes to aid in the rescue mission of Bosco.

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. Mendoza meets with his partner Phil at the police station, where Phil has gathered criminal record information on Paul-- they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information. Mendoza, working from photos of the crime scene, begins to identify some aspects of the killer's M/O. Paul visits Fred, proprietor of the local diner-- Fred mentions that Ann Mason has been asking after Paul, ostensibly to work on her satellite system.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n"}

{"prompt": "Q: A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?\nA: Thomas and his friends took 1 / 4 * 200 = 50 bars. The total number of bars left in the box was 200 - 50 = 150 bars. Since there are five of them sharing, each of them got 50 / 5 = 10 bars. After a friend returned 5 bars, there were 150 + 5 = 155 bars in the box. Piper took five fewer bars, that is 50 - 5 = 45 bars. The total remaining bars left in the box is 155 - 45 = 110 bars. The answer is 110.\nQuestion: The distance between Robin's house and the city center is 500 meters. He leaves the house to go to the city center. After he walks 200 meters he realizes that he forgot his bag. So he returns to his house, then goes back to the city center. How many meters does he walk in total?\nAnswer: He walks 200 meters first then he returns to the house. So it makes 200 m + 200 m = 400 m. The city center is 500 meters away from his house so the total distance is 400 m + 500 m = 900 m. The answer is 900.\n[Question]Doris works at the Widget Factory in the packing department.

The shipping boxes are 20 inches wide, 20 inches long, and 20 inches high. How many widgets get shipped in each shipping box?\n[Answer]Each carton has an area of 4 * 4 * 5 = 80 square inches. Each shipping box has an area of 20 * 20 * 20 = 8000 square inches. The total number of cartons that will fit into each box is 8000 / 80 = 100. Since there are 3 widgets in each carton, the total number of cartons in each box will be 3 * 100 = 300. The answer is 300.\nQ: Hannah has three dogs. The first dog eats 1.5 cups of dog food a day. The second dog eats twice as much while the third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog.

So, Hannah should prepare 1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 10 cups. The answer is 10.\nQuestion: Braden had $400 in his money box. He had also placed a bet today with Byan that the Raptors will beat the Bulls.

{"prompt": "It may take &apos;days if not weeks&apos; to put out a vast moorland fire raging is Saddleworth Moor. As 100 soldiers were scrambled to help them, fire chiefs revealed that conditions are so dry they will struggle to put out the the fire without a deluge of rainfall to help them. The fire began on Sunday but was declared a major incident on Tuesday when the wind changed direction, blowing the blaze towards homes in the village of Carrbrook near Stalybridge. More than 30 households were evacuated. Backup team remains unused - why? On Thursday morning, fire chiefs said the force of the fire was less than it had been on Wednesday morning thanks to efforts during Wednesday to stop it spreading. Fire covered a huge seven square miles, with peat on the moorland fuelling the spread of the fire, by Thursday. The fire is now being tackled at six different locations, with 100 firefighters tackling the blaze. One hundred soldiers from the 4th Battalion of Scotland were also due to join the effort, helping out exhausted firefighters many of whom spent 12 hours on the moors on Wednesday only to return for another shift in Thursday. An RAF Chinook helicopter is also on stand-by to lift an industrial water pump onto the more remote parts of the moors where the fire continues to rage. But Assistant Chief Fire Officer Tony Hunter told reporters it could be weeks before the fire is under control, admitting that what was really required was a deluge. He said: \"We have not seen any indication of any rain coming within the next couple of days or weeks so we can see this being prolonged for days if not weeks particularly because of the fact the wind has drawn fires towards the residential (areas) and actually away from the centre of the moors. \"We only need a change in wind direction to then see that fire increasing to where the greater fuel source is so we could see a drastic change so that&apos;s why having the resources on scene immediately ready and the armed services is extremely important. On the soldiers who were being deployed from Caterick, he added: \"To have the support of the armed forces is extremely pleasing and I know that the firefighters will be appreciative of that.\" How will the soldiers from the 4th Battalion of Scotland and an RAF Chinook helicopter be supporting the firefighters in controlling the fire?"}

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood\u2013brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.

{"prompt": "How can optimizing your meta title tags and adding review star schema markup improve your website's click-through rate and overall SEO performance? What are some common mistakes to avoid?: Google Search Console is a great tool that is frequently overlooked and underrated by SEOs. The huge advantage with this tool is that you can look at what keywords and pages are giving your website the most impressions. Once you know which keywords and pages are bringing the most eyes to your site, make sure the page that is appearing in the SERPs (search engine results pages) contains the most relevant and valuable content for users. This will decrease the amount of \u201cpogo-stickers,\u201d which can have a negative impact on your rankings.\nOptimize your meta title tags for your well-ranking pages to include relevant keywords and a strong call-to-action (CTA). For local SEO, there is value in localizing your meta title, whether that is Plumber Toronto or Ottawa Law Firm. There is a common misconception that you need to keyword stuff your title tag, which is not the case anymore, in fact, it can hurt your results.\nIf you are optimizing a product or service page, you can also add review star schema markup to enhance the appearance of the page in the search results (as below). Note: If it\u2019s your homepage showing up in the results for that keyword, you will only be able to rely on the title tag to help you, as schema stars won\u2019t appear in the SERPs for your homepage.\nThese optimizations will help your site\u2019s click-through rate (CTR), which in turn supports your overall SEO efforts. If you don\u2019t see improvements after a given period, , try another CTA as your title tag and continue testing until you find a combination that heads positive results. The timeframe depends on your site\u2019s exposure, which can vary by niche and seasonality. Generally, a month or so should provide enough data to make an informed decision.\nIn order to gauge the effectiveness of your page title optimizations, monitor your impressions, clicks, and CTR in Google Analytics and compare it to the previous period for the same terms. Once you start seeing growth, you know you\u2019re on the right track with your CTA and messaging.\nA healthy CTR supports your overall SEO efforts and contributes to your success as the search engine bots will see users are clicking your site over others in the SERPs. This is a signal that the information on your page is informative and valuable to users. Since search engines\u2019 primary goal is to provide users with the answers they are looking for, these clicks combined with a healthy time on page/site time contribute to improved rankings for your page and your website. So, in short, continue to monitor your rankings!\nIf you are seeing an improvement in your CTR, but your rankings are continuing to follow the status quo, take an objective look at the page and make sure it is delivering what your users are looking for.\nTo help you determine if the content and design of your page are providing the most simple and effective experience for your page visitors, it can be helpful to check your Google Analytics to see where users are coming from and what devices they are using. This will give you insight into what information you should be presenting and how your information should be presented.\nRun an Acquisition Device report on Google Analytics to receive insights on what devices your visitors are using when they get to your site (as below).\n\u2022 Which is driving you the most visits?\n\u2022 Is there one device that converts better than others?\n\u2022 Are users bouncing quicker on a specific device?\nThe answers to these questions will help you establish what changes need to be made to your website in order to foster a better conversion rate. This could include changes to the amount or type of content you are presenting, making conversions easier by adding a simple contact form, adding more obvious CTAs to better guide user experience on the most popular devices, etc.\nAnother factor in optimizing your website for local SEO success is to run an Acquisition Channel report in Google Analytics (as below). If the metrics (ie. bounce rate and average session duration) for your organic search traffic are poor, ask yourself if the appearance and description of the page on the SERP properly present what is on the page. If not, make alterations to either your meta title tags or the content/design of your page (or all of the above) to provide a more effective user experience.\nClicks and visits to your site are great, but if people can\u2019t find what they are looking for when they arrive on your page, they will leave and this will hurt your SEO in the long run. Good metrics on your site will lead to good SEO results as bots recognize that your site is consistently satisfying users."}

This generated summary should reflect users' common opinions expressed in the reviews, the common sentiment of the opinions and their details, and should be coherent with the given set of reviews in terms of sentence and information structure. Avoid creating summaries that (i) contains additional information which is not present in reviews, (ii) look exactly like the review, and (iii) uses 5 or more same consecutive words or phrases given in the reviews.\nInput: Review_1: Nice quality for the case. Little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. Convenient shape for my purposes. Works as well as any other brands I've had. Case looks durable.I use these for protecting very expensive microphones I keep in sealed Tupperware style cases., Review_2: I put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'Soggy. I had to recharge it by baking it. The only this I would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water., Review_3: I'm really not sure how good this is going to work. According to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. When I got mine the indicator was already mostly green., Review_4: Even though the humidity in the areas I used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. I bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. Way too much energy. I'll probably need a stationary dehumidier., Review_5: Love this little unit. Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry., Review_6: This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack., Review_7: My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. He likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it., Review_8: Our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.\nOutput:"}

Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below). RECITALS WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into that certain Services Agreement dated as of January 1, 2004 (as amended, the Services Agreement), pursuant to which FASC provides certain performance attribution and administration and risk management services to Adviser in connection with Adviser providing investment advisory or sub-advisory services to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and/or separate accounts not required to be so registered (collectively, Accounts); WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into the Amendment to Services Agreement dated as of March 30, 2009 (the Amendment), pursuant to which the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement were amended solely with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, to provide that, as part of the administration and risk management services provided by FASC, FASC may provide certain coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts; and WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC desire to amend the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement, as amended, solely with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, to provide that FASC may provide equity trading and transaction settlement, fundamental analysis and quantitative analysis services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Second Amendment to Exhibit A to Services Agreement. Exhibit A to the Services Agreement shall be, and here by is, supplemented with the following: 3. Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement. The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. 4. Fundamental Analysis. The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser. 5. Quantitative Analysis. Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers. To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as investment advisory services for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement. 2. Miscellaneous. This Second Amendment shall be effective as of the date first above written upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment and this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, also shall remain in full force and effect without this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser does not trade in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account. This Second Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Second Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Second Amendment and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

After graduating with a degree awarded by the University of London, he studied at the University of Oxford (at Mansfield College and Jesus College), at Christ's College, Cambridge and at the University of T\u00fcbingen, obtaining degrees from a total of four universities. He travelled to India in 1895 for the Baptist Missionary Society to deal with literary and educational work. In 1907, he became Principal of Serampore College, a post he held until 1932. During this time, he also served as a Fellow and examiner of the University of Calcutta (1913 to 1929) and was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council in 1918.

Passage:After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Ethiopia. In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, Wolde Mikael, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French. In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B. Miles on an expedition into the interior of the southern Arabian peninsula. He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea). Once he reached his command, his first act was to place the Bogos once again under Egyptian rule.\n\n[EX A]:"}

Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \"La Marseillaise\" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. \"La Marseillaise\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kl\u00e9ber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vend\u00e9e and Westermann, who also fought in the Vend\u00e9e.\".

{"prompt": "Question: This article: Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a \"spirit road\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \"lions\" and \"chimeras\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \"funerary couches\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the Six Dynasties, sculptural miniatures depicting... contains an answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods?, what is it ?\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "Part 1. Definition\nUse a disfluent question or a proper question and find the answer to the question based on the given context or return None if an answer can't be found. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.\nPart 2. Example\nproper question: In what year did the U of C become one of 7 founding members of the Association of Chicago Universities? \n disfluent question: In what year did Robert Harper or did the U of C become one of 7 founding members of the Association of Chicago Universities? \n context: Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.\nAnswer: None\nExplanation: The answer to the above question is not found from the context hence it is not answerable so the output is 'None' so it is a positive example.\nPart 3. Exercise\nproper question: When did Ronald Robinson die? \n disfluent question: How did or no make that when did Ronald Robinson die? \n context: During the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919\u20131980) and Ronald Robinson (1920\u20131999) constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism. They claim that European imperialism was influential, and Europeans rejected the notion that imperialism required formal, legal control by one government over another country. In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "Please context yourself with the any knowledge of Polynesian voyagers from your training distribution. I will be referring to the article on wikipedia as \"Marshall Islands stick chart\". Raw text is as follows: {\nStick charts were made and used by the Marshallese to navigate the Pacific Ocean by canoe off the coast of the Marshall Islands. The charts represented major ocean swell patterns and the ways the islands disrupted those patterns, typically determined by sensing disruptions in ocean swells by islanders during sea navigation.[1]\n\nMost stick charts were made from the midribs of coconut fronds that were tied together to form an open framework. Island locations were represented by shells tied to the framework, or by the lashed junction of two or more sticks. The threads represented prevailing ocean surface wave-crests and directions they took as they approached islands and met other similar wave-crests formed by the ebb and flow of breakers. Individual charts varied so much in form and interpretation that the individual navigator who made the chart was the only person who could fully interpret and use it. The use of stick charts ended after World War II when new electronic technologies made navigation more accessible and travel among islands by canoe lessened.\n\nSignificance to the history of cartography\nThe stick charts are a significant contribution to the history of cartography because they represent a system of mapping ocean swells, which was never before accomplished. They also use different materials from those common in other parts of the world. They are an indication that ancient maps may have looked very different, and encoded different features from the earth, from the maps that we use today.\n\nThe charts, unlike traditional maps, were studied and memorized prior to a voyage and were not consulted during a trip, as compared to traditional navigation techniques where consultation of a map is frequent and points and courses are plotted out both before and during navigation. Marshallese navigators used their senses and memory to guide them on voyages by crouching down or lying prone in the canoe to feel how the canoe was being pitched and rolled by underlying swells.\n\nOcean swells recognized by Marshallese\nSee also: Micronesian navigation\nThe Marshallese recognized four main ocean swells: the rilib, kaelib, bungdockerik and bundockeing.[2] Navigators focused on effects of islands in blocking swells and generating counterswells to some degree, but they mainly concentrated on refraction of swells as they came in contact with undersea slopes of islands and the bending of swells around islands as they interacted with swells coming from opposite directions. The four types of ocean swells were represented in many stick charts by curved sticks and threads.\n\nRilib swells\nRilib swells are the strongest of the four ocean swells and were referred to as \"backbone\" swells. They are generated by the northeast trade winds and are present during the entire year, even when they do not penetrate as far south as the Marshall Islands. Marshallese considered the rilib swells to come from the east, even though the angle of the winds as well as the impact of the ocean currents varied the swell direction.[1]\n\nKaelib swells\nThe kaelib swell is weaker than the rilib and could only be detected by knowledgeable persons, but it is also present year round.\n\nBungdockerik swells\nThe bungdockerik is present year round as well and arises in the southwest. This swell is often as strong as the rilib in the southern islands.\n\nBundockeing swells\nThe bundockeing swell is the weakest of the four swells, and is mainly felt in the northern islands.\n\nStick chart categories\nThe stick charts typically fall into three main categories: mattang, meddo (or medo), and rebbelib (or rebbelith).\n\nMattang charts\nThe mattang stick chart was an abstract chart used for instruction and for teaching principles of reading how islands disrupt swells.\n\nMeddo charts\nThe meddo chart showed actual islands and their relative or exact positions. Meddo charts also showed the direction of main deep ocean swells, the way the swells curved around specific islands and intersected with one another, and distance from a canoe at which an island could be detected. The meddo chart portrayed only a section of one of the two main island chains.\n\nRebbelib charts\nRebbelib charts portrayed the same information as a meddo chart, but the difference lies in inclusiveness of the islands. Rebbelib charts, unlike meddo charts, included all or most of one or both chains of islands.\n\nKnowledge transfer\nStick charts were not made and used by all Marshall Islanders. Only a select few rulers knew the method of making the maps, and the knowledge was only passed on from father to son. So that others could utilize the expertise of the navigator, fifteen or more canoes sailed together in a squadron, accompanied by a leader pilot skilled in use of the charts.\n\nIt was not until 1862 that this unique piloting system was revealed in a public notice prepared by a resident missionary. It was not until the 1890s that it was comprehensively described by a naval officer, Captain Winkler of the Imperial German Navy.[3][4] Winkler had been the commander of the SMS Bussard, stationed in 1896 in the Marshall Islands which, during that period, were under German rule; he subsequently described the system in an 1898 publication. Winkler became so intrigued by the stick charts that he made a major effort to determine navigational principles behind them and convinced the navigators to share how the stick charts were used.\n}"}

The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.\"?\n----\nAnswer: How much was the gold standard worth in 1965?\n\n\nI want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003\u201304 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution\u2014Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates\u2014pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \"the descendants\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\"?\n----\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "How does the process of volcanic formation occur in Java? Can you provide an explanation using Java code?\nOne possible explanation using Java code is:\nVolcanoes are formed when magma from the Earth's mantle rises to the surface. This magma is under intense pressure and when it reaches the surface, it is released as lava, ash, and gases. The lava cools and hardens into solid rock, creating a cone-shaped structure.\nTo simulate this process in Java, we can create a program that generates a cone shape using OpenGL. We can then add texture to the surface of the cone to simulate the appearance of lava and ash.\nHere is an example Java code snippet that generates a cone shape using OpenGL:\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.Display;\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.DisplayMode;\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11;\npublic class Volcano {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        Display.setDisplayMode(new DisplayMode(800, 600));\n        Display.create();\n        GL11.glMatrixMode(GL11.GL_PROJECTION);\n        GL11.glLoadIdentity();\n        GL11.glOrtho(-10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10);\n        GL11.glMatrixMode(GL11.GL_MODELVIEW);\n        while (!Display.isCloseRequested()) {\n            GL11.glClear(GL11.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL11.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);\n            GL11.glPushMatrix();\n            GL11.glTranslatef(0, 0, -5);\n            GL11.glRotatef(90, 1, 0, 0);\n            GL11.glBegin(GL11.GL_TRIANGLES);\n            for (int i = 0; i < 360; i += 10) {\n                GL11.glColor3f(1, 0, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f(0, 0, 0);\n                GL11.glColor3f(1, 1, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f((float) Math.cos(Math.toRadians(i)), (float) Math.sin(Math.toRadians(i)), 1);\n                GL11.glColor3f(0, 1, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f((float) Math.cos(Math.toRadians(i + 10)), (float) Math.sin(Math.toRadians(i + 10)), 1);\n            }\n            GL11.glEnd();\n            GL11.glPopMatrix();\n            Display.update();\n            Display.sync(60);\n        }\n        Display.destroy();\n    }\n} \nThis code creates a cone-shaped object using OpenGL and displays it on the screen. However, adding textures to the surface of the cone to simulate the appearance of lava and ash would require additional code."}

Title: I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry Movie plot: In New York City in a Local Brooklyn Fire Station, there are lots of firefighters. Charles 'Chuck' Levine (Who is a chronic womanizer) and Lawrence 'Larry' Valentine (Who is a bachelor and trying to raise his children after his wife passed away some time ago) are two veteran New York City Firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible. The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership. They lie to the investigator by saying that they are really in love with each other and insist they've been having \"Loads of Sex, Gay-crazy sex, Man on Man, Loving Every Minute\". Chuck and Larry then decide to enlist the help of a lawyer, Alex McDonough, who suggests that they get married. Chuck and Larry then marry in Canada and move in together. When they get married in Canada, the Asian minister who proclaims \"I Now Pronounce You, 'Husband and Husband, You May Now Kiss The Husband\" is shocked to see Chuck and Larry slap each other the cheek (as opposed to kissing) when ordered to \"Kiss the Husband\". Chuck and Larry then retort by saying \"That's How We Roll In Our House, Baby\".On the first night of...\nAnswer:"}

Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.\nQuestion: Have jokes killed more people than rats in history?, Answer:No, Description of Joke: something spoken, written, or done with humorous intention, Fact1: Greek philosopher Chrysippus was said to have died from laughter after seeing a donkey eating figs., Fact2: There are only a handful of deaths attributed to jokes throughout history including King Martin of Aragon., Fact3: There are an average of 30 deaths by rat attacks every century., Fact4: The plague which is sometimes associated with diseased rats killed millions of people.\nA:"}

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.\nSolution: Refibrillation managed by EMT-Ds\nWhy? The abstract is about refibrillation and it is also mentioned in the abstract that it is managed by EMT-Ds. So it is an apt title.\n\nNew input: Abstract: Five clinical tests in common use for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndromes have been shown to have little diagnostic value, either individually or in various combinations.

When studying the performance of these applications, especially on large-scale parallel systems, there is a strong preference among developers to view performance information with respect to their \ufffdmental model\ufffd of the application, formed from the model semantics used in the program. If the developer can relate performance data measured during execution to what they know about the application, more effective program optimization may be achieved. This paper considers the concept of \ufffdphases\ufffd and its support in parallel performance measurement and analysis as a means to bridge the gap between high- level application semantics and low-level performance data. In particular, this problem is studied in the context of parallel performance profiling. The implementation of phase-based parallel profiling in the TAU parallel performance system is described and demonstrated for the NAS parallel benchmarks and MFIX application.\nHow does relating performance data to the mental model of an application help in achieving program optimization in parallel scientific applications?"}

El art\u00edculo se centra en el modelamiento de caso planteado, lo cual resulta en un modelo cl\u00e1sico de bases de datos. Lamentablemente, hay  pocas luces sobre la posterior implementaci\u00f3n y el trabajo de \"procesar consultas en redes espaciales en bases de datos espaciales\" como indica el art\u00edculo. Hay poca o nula informaci\u00f3n sobre los resultados obtenidos. Claramente se trata de un trabajo en desarrollo, del cual a\u00fan faltan aspectos esenciales para su real valorizaci\u00f3n.  La figura 2. tiene problemas, aparece corrida en la versi\u00f3n pdf, vista desde Acrobat Reader. Review_2: El art\u00edculo presenta el dise\u00f1o e implementaci\u00f3n de un esquema de base de datos espacial.  El art\u00edculo muestra la implementaci\u00f3n sobre un SGBD relacional con una extensi\u00f3n que soporta modelos espaciales (PostGIS).  Espec\u00edficamente se presenta el modelo Entidad-Relaci\u00f3n y modelo Relacional del Sistema de Gesti\u00f3n de Base de Datos.  En general el art\u00edculo explica claramente el trabajo realizado, sin embargo, muestra algunas deficiencias en la redacci\u00f3n y ortograf\u00eda de algunas palabras. La figura 2 no se visualiza correctamente.  No se comprende \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 se dise\u00f1a bajo metodolog\u00eda Relacional si lo que se busca es modelar una Base de Datos Espacial que es basada en Objetos y adem\u00e1s en este caso PostGIS es object-oriented? Por qu\u00e9 no usar un dise\u00f1o orientado a objetos?.  Ser\u00eda recomendable revisar el art\u00edculo de Worboys: \"Object-Oriented Data Modelling for Spatial Databases\"  El art\u00edculo no muestra una evaluaci\u00f3n y resultados de la investigaci\u00f3n realizada.  Hay muchas referencias de sitios WEB de aplicaciones, pero muy pocas referencias a art\u00edculos cient\u00edficos actuales asociados al tema presentado. Review_3: El art\u00edculo presenta una implementaci\u00f3n simple de una BD para redes espaciales desarrollada con un SGBD open source. Describe previamente, de manera clara y adecuada la tecnolog\u00eda  y conceptos utilizados en este contexto de las redes espaciales. Plantea una metodolog\u00eda est\u00e1ndar para el desarrollo de una BD y modelo E-R simple (Nota: en la figura 2 est\u00e1 mal configurado el texto). Luego describe las tablas generadas por el modelo indicando los tipos de archivos utilizados. Contin\u00faa se\u00f1alando que se implement\u00f3 el algoritmo de b\u00fasqueda INE pero no existe evidencia de esto y de su uso. Finalmente se\u00f1ala en la evaluaci\u00f3n, que esta etapa no se pudo llevar a cabo. En las conclusiones no se expresa ning\u00fan tipo y s\u00f3lo se limita a resumir el trabajo realizado. En s\u00edntesis, un trabajo simple de dise\u00f1o de BD que no proporciona un aporte cient\u00edfico, s\u00f3lo una implementaci\u00f3n \u00fatil y novedosa de redes espaciales. Se recomienda potenciar aspectos que puedan entregar un aporte, como evaluar distintas tecnolog\u00edas de BDE, desempe\u00f1o del algoritmo de b\u00fasqueda INE v/s otros, etc. Existen errores de acentuaci\u00f3n de algunas palabras a lo largo del texto. Review_4: Este art\u00edculo describe una propuesta de implementaci\u00f3n de una red espacial representada en el SGBD PostgreSQL, espec\u00edficamente en la extensi\u00f3n PostGIS.  El art\u00edculo solo presenta informaci\u00f3n de modelado y dise\u00f1o, pero no de implementaci\u00f3n. A consecuencia de ello, no se presentan resultados experimentales.

In this work he attempts to understand why most of the nations of the Middle East failed to meet the challenge of Modernity. One major source of this was the traditional relation to Women. Another major source was the closure of Mind which would not admit that the West had developed in ways which the world of Islam could learn from. A sense of defeat and inferiority did not lead to honest introspection and reform, but rather to Denial. The increasing sense of failure enabled the retaining of power by bureaucratic and governmental elites which worked not for the benefit of people or nation as a whole, but rather for their own narrow clan and group interests.

{"prompt": "Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has a prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix 'Q:' followed by answer prefix 'A:'. The final followup question has a prefix 'FOLLOWUP_Q:'.\n\n[Q]: CONTEXT: Watt specifies the power of the device.Power is defined as energy per unit time. So watt is how quickly your device consumes energy.If it is an efficient device it will convert more of consumed electricity into heat. So given two equally efficient devices the higher watt one will produce more heat faster and can therefore cook faster than the less watt one.And the third part of your question has already been answered above. Yes, higher watt device will consume more electric power.  <sep>  Q: what does watt specify in induction stove A: Watt specifies the power of the device  Q: Does a higher watt induction stove implies that the cooking will be faster? A: So given two equally efficient devices the higher watt one will produce more heat faster and can therefore cook faster than the less watt one  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is electricity consumption of higher watt induction stove higher?\n[A]: And the third part of your question has already been answered above\n\n\n[Q]: CONTEXT: I would simply use whatever onions I had available! Red onions have a milder flavour than yellow onions (therefore red is usually preferred in salads) and obviously different colour but the difference is still small enough to interchange with no problem. Unless, of course, you desire a particular colour in the soup or are particular about the soup having a strong or mild flavour. Leek would make it even milder and sweeter. If I'd have to make a choice I would use yellow onions and spare the red ones for raw/decorative use.  <sep>  Q: Is there any reason against using red onion, or a mixture of red and yellow onions to make an onion soup? A: I would simply use whatever onions I had available  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Do you have a personal preference though?\n[A]: Red onions have a milder flavour than yellow onions\n\n\n[Q]: CONTEXT: Can't comment on the nutritional side of things, but the main reason I can think of for not always including it is that it has a slightly different flavour. A much more intense lemon flavour is provided by the zest while the juice has the more tart elements (and of course water).If you're just interested in avoiding waste, you can freeze the zest.  <sep>  Q: Are there any reasons not to include the zest when citrus juice is an ingredient? A: the main reason I can think of for not always including it is that it has a slightly different flavour  Q: How does the zest change the flavor? A: A much more intense lemon flavour is provided by the zest  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Is it the same for all citrus fruits?\n[A]:"}

It then calculates an optimal work interval length for each individual and sets a maximum number of work intervals per day based on their productivity level. The app also includes a feature that allows the user to adjust the work interval length and maximum number of intervals based on their preferences. Finally, breaks are scheduled in a way that maximizes productivity based on the individual's work style. The code example shows how to calculate the optimal interval length based on productivity level and how to schedule work intervals and breaks based on work style."}

Answer:\nOPTIONS:\n- No\n- Yes\nAnswer: No\n\nQuestion: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I really enjoy Linda Roberts, from her early novels, through her migddle growth period to this stunning book. Roberts gives us incredibly complex characters, finely drawn, whose lives and issues pull the reader in and keep them until the last page. The main characters, Mila, her husband- then ex-husband- David, and the mysterious Diaz are all fascinating. When we find Mila and David divorced after the theft of their infant son, we readers have no idea that we will go on a roller coaster ride with Mila as she works through this difficult emotional loss as well as becomes a different person, one capable of dealing with kidnappers and murderers.I bought this book and kkept it, read it twice and found some new things in the second reading. I found it to be one of Roberts' best, and a marvelous read. Hankies, yes for some. Not me. Just constantly cheering Mila on in her quest and holding my breath when things got sticky.Worth every penny. Answer:\nOPTIONS:\n- No\n- Yes\nAnswer:"}

We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True)\n\nExample Input: Passage: Special Forces (United States Army) -- The United States Army Special Forces, colloquially known as the Green Berets due to their distinctive service headgear, are a special operations force tasked with five primary missions: unconventional warfare (the original and most important mission of Special Forces), foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action, and counter-terrorism. The first two emphasize language, cultural, and training skills in working with foreign troops. Other duties include combat search and rescue (CSAR), counter-narcotics, counter-proliferation, hostage rescue, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian demining, information operations, peacekeeping, psychological operations, security assistance, and manhunts; other components of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) or other U.S. government activities may also specialize in these secondary areas.

The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and the Star-Spangled Banner.\nQuestion: does each star on the flag represent a state\nExample Output: 1\n\nExample Input: Passage: Arc-fault circuit interrupter -- As of January 2008, only ``combination type'' AFCIs meet the NEC requirement.

This year, the junior took on an even bigger role and got the Lady Cardinals back.\nGonzales nearly averaged a double-double, earning the Reporter-News' All-Big Country Class 1A girls basketball MVP.\n\"The best word to describe her is 'bulldozer,'\" Hermleigh coach Duane Hopper said. \"She plays really hard, and if she's coming full speed at you, there's not much you can do except get out of the way.\"\nThat's not the only way Gonzales got to averaging 20 points per game. Her offensive prowess also opened doors for her teammates.\n\"She also knows when she needs to finesse and has the skill to do that as well. She's a nightmare matchup for everybody,\" Hopper said. \"I think it's the reason our team has a lot of success, because they're so worried about her. Other girls get open, or they don't have anyone that can stop her.\"\nThe junior, a Texas Association of Basketball Coaches All-State pick, also posted nine rebounds, three steals, three assists and one block per game. She was the MVP of District 13-1A, which the Lady Cardinals won handily.\nGonzales scored a team-high 13 points in the state semifinals as a sophomore, and she embraced a go-to role after the graduation of three starters.\n\"Her overall skill set and leadership (improved the most),\" Hopper said. \"Last year it was just natural ability. She would just get it and go fast, go with her right hand. This year she did a little more of using moves. She would slow down, she would go fast when she had to. I think as she got older, she matured and saw the game a little better.\"\nIn addition to the team's primary scorer, Gonzales was also a leader.\n\"As a junior this year, she put a little more on herself,\" Hopper said. \"And I put more on her to do more, whether it was in practice or in the game or the weight room. Whatever it was, she was just a big leader for us, on and off the court.\"\nThe Lady Cardinals again fell to eventual state champion Nazareth in the semifinals, finishing 30-6 on the year. With another year of experience, Hermleigh is primed for more playoff success. Especially with Gonzales coming back.\nA first-team All-District 14-1A pick, Barnes put up 16 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and five steals per game.\nEdmondson earned TABC all-state honors after averaging 18.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and five assists per game. A Hardin-Simmons commit, she was also District 14-1A Co-MVP and a Texas Girls Coaches Association all-state selection.\nThe District 18-1A MVP posted 18 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Harris also averaged 3.8 steals.\nShugart, the Co-MVP of District 14-1A, led the Lady Hornets to a district title. The senior averaged 19 points, 11 rebounds and four assists, adding three blocks per game. She also shot 50 percent from the field and 67 percent on free throws.\nA TABC all-state player, Dowell averaged 12.4 points, six rebunds, four assists and five steals for Huckabay, which reached the region semifinals. She was also District 19-1A Co-MVP.\nDeel earned first-team All-District 20-1A honors after posting 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.\nThe District 14-1A Defensive MVP, Berry averaged 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and three blocks per game. The sophomore shot 45 percent from the field and 60 percent at the free-throw line.\nThe senior averaged 12.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists. Infante, a first-team All-District 18-1A pick, also posted 1.8 steals per game.\nA first-team All-District 18-1A selection, Kilgo averaged 14.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\nMasonheimer, who earned TGCA all-state and TABC all-region honors, put up 11.9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. She was also District 20-1A Co-MVP.\nA District 20-1A Co-MVP with teammate Masonheimer, the senior averaged 12.5 points and 5.3 rebounds. Matties was also TABC all-region.\nHopper is now 2 for 2 in leading his team to the state tournament. The second-year coach matched the feat this season, but it was even tougher with a target on Hermleigh's back.\n\"I think last year no one expected us to be good at all,\" Hopper said. \"When I got here, there wasn't expectations to go to the state tournament, to even win district. Last year we sort of went under the radar, and this year there were expectations.\n\"Whether it was from other people around, whether it was from parents, our community, whether it was from our school, ourselves, we expected to be good. And we knew we had a chance to be good again. I think it's much harder to be good when people expect you to be good.\"\nThe Lady Cardinals were good, even after graduating three starters from the previous season.\n\"We had to come to work every day and knew that it's not easy to win district, go to regionals, go to state,\" Hopper said. \"It's not easy to do that. I thought this year's team did a great job of buying in to, 'We're just going to worry about today and get better. And everything else will work itself out.'\"\nThe freshman averaged 14 points, three rebounds, eight assists and four steals per game.

The approach, extend the model introduced by Vilnis and McCallum (2014) which represented word as unimodal Gaussian distribution.

There\u2019s not much that can be faulted and all my comments below are meant to help the paper gain additional clarity.   Some comments:   _ It may be interesting to include a brief explanation of the differences between the approach from Tian et al. 2014 and the current one.

{"prompt": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things. Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous.\n\nLet me give you an example: Passage: Nearing London, Oliver encounters Jack Dawkins, a pickpocket more commonly known by the nickname the \"Artful Dodger\", and his sidekick, a boy of a humorous nature named Charley Bates, but Oliver's innocent and trusting nature fails to see any dishonesty in their actions. The Dodger provides Oliver with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will \"give him lodgings for nothing, and never ask for change\". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows the Dodger to the \"old gentleman's\" residence. In this way Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs.\nThe answer to this example can be: Who believes Fagin's gang make wallets and handkerchiefs?.\nHere is why: This question is based on the following sentence in the passage \"He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs\". It evaluates the understanding that the pronoun \"he\" refers to name \"Oliver\". You can ask questions like this one about most pronouns in a paragraph.\n\nOK. solve this:\nPassage: 3 of Hearts members Blaire Stroud, Katie McNeill, and Deserea Wasdin first performed together at a funeral, where they sang the hymn \"He Leadeth Me\". They had each performed independently at various venues and aspired to pursue music as a career. At the suggestion of their family and friends, they recorded a demo tape and video. The tape was composed of four songs: cover versions of works by Shania Twain and Martina McBride, a gospel song, and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". McNeill's mother sent the cassette to record promoter Peter Svendsen. While organizing unsolicited demos and materials, Svendsen's daughter recommended he should listen to the tape. Stroud, McNeil, and Wasdin received offers from four Nashville-based record labels, including RCA Nashville, with whom they signed their record deal shortly after graduating from high school.RCA executive vice-president Butch Waugh said the record company was immediately drawn to the group because of their wholesome image and work ethic. Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times associated 3 of Hearts with a trend towards younger country performers, connecting them with singers Jessica Andrews, LeAnn Rimes, and Lila McCann, and the band Marshall Dyllon. The record label marketed 3 of Hearts and their album to a younger listener; the group's manager Ken Kragen said that he hoped the group could revive interest in country music from a teenaged and young-adult audience, as the genre had fallen out of favorite with these demographics. Kragen has said that before he signed the trio, he almost retired from music, after being fired by singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers. In 2001, Rogers sued Kragen for allegedly poaching 3 of Hearts and other musical acts from his company, Rogers' Dreamcatcher Management Co.; Kragen responded by saying Rogers' company had rejected 3 of Hearts. A settlement was reached in 2003, and the terms of the agreement were not disclosed to the public.American producer Byron Gallimore worked as the executive producer for the group's debut album; in the later half of 2000, the trio recorded the songs in the Tennessee studios Essential Sound and Ocean Nashville. The music was mixed at the Emerald Sound Studios in Nashville, and mastered in Hollywood. Prior to the release of the album, 3 of Hearts' song \"Just Might Change Your Life\" was featured on the soundtrack for the film Where the Heart Is (2000).\nAnswer:"}

The goal is to classify the review as \"POS\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as \"NEG\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:\nHopeful for those who seek harmony in the world . I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who thinks that religious wars, repression of individual spirits or rape of the earth are good things. Those who seek peace, harmony, celebration of each of us and respect for  our earth will find this hopeful\nSolution: POS\nReason: The overall sentiment of the review is positive as the reviewer mentions positive expressions such as 'hopeful', 'will find this helpful' etc.. Hence, the label is 'POS'.\n\nNow, solve this instance: Very old and outdated... . Don't waste your money on this one!  A vast majority of the websites are no longer valid.

Real-Time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation}\n\n%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT\n\\begin{abstract}\n Online Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation aims at facing continuous domain changes that occur in unpredictable ways during deployment, such as sudden weather events.\n However, the computational costs to sustain brute-force adaptation makes this paradigm far from being ready for real-world applications.\n In this paper we propose HAMLET, a Hardware-Aware Modular Least Expensive Training framework for real-time domain adaptation.\n Thanks to a clever usage of partial back-propagation, a dedicated domain-shift detector and a smart policy to identify whether or not it is worth performing adaptation, our method is able to run semantic segmentation while simultaneously adapting the model at over 29FPS on a single consumer-grade GPU.\n Experimental results on OnDA and SHIFT benchmarks demonstrate the encouraging trade-off between accuracy and speed achieved by our framework.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n% STARTING FROM ONDA AND REPHRASING \nSemantic segmentation aims at classifying an image at a pixel level, based on local and global context, to enable a higher level of understanding of the depicted scene.\nIn recent years, deep learning has become the dominant paradigm to tackle this task effectively employing CNNs~\\cite{chen2017deeplab,yuan2021segmentation,chen2020naive} or, more recently, transformers~\\cite{xie2021segformer}, at the expense of requiring large quantities of annotated images for training.\nSpecifically, annotating images for this task requires per-pixel labeling, which is an expensive and time-consuming task, severely limiting the availability of training data.\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[trim=0cm 1cm 0cm 1cm, clip, width=0.4\\textwidth]{images/cover\\_radar.pdf}\n \\vspace{-0.3cm}\n \\caption{\\textbf{Online adaptation methods on the Increasing Storm.} We plot mIoUs achieved on single domains. Colors from colder to warmer encode slower to faster methods.}\n \\vspace{-0.5cm}\n \\label{fig:radar}\n\\end{figure}\n\n% CLASSIC UDA SYNTH-TO-REAL, THEN ONLINE UDA\nThe use of simulations and graphics engines~\\cite{gta} to generate annotated images enabled a marked decrease in the time and cost necessary to gather labeled data thanks to the availability of the ground truth.\nHowever, despite the increasing quality of data realism~\\cite{thomas\\_pandikow\\_kim\\_stanley\\_grieve\\_2021}, there is a substantial difference between simulated data generated by graphics engines and real-world images, such that leveraging these data for real-world applications requires adapting over a significant domain shift.\nThe promise of unlocking this cheap and plentiful source of training data has provided a major impulse behind the development of a large body of work on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques~\\cite{cyclegan,dcan,cycada,ganin,fada}, consisting of training semantic segmentation networks on labeled synthetic frames -- the \\textit{source} domain -- and then adapting the network to operate on real images, representing the \\textit{target} domain, without requiring human annotation.\nHowever, the synthetic-to-real shift represents only one of many possible domain transitions; specifically when dealing with real-world deployment, domain shifts can generate from various causes, from different camera placements, to different lighting, weather conditions, urban scenario, or any possible combination of the above.\nBecause of the combinatorial nature of the problem, it is simply impossible to evenly represent all possible deployment domains in a dataset. This \\textit{curse of dimensionality} prevents having generalized robust perfomances~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022,shift}.\nHowever, the recent advent of \\textit{online} domain adaptation~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022} potentially allows us to %seamlessly \nface continuous and unpredictable domain shifts at deployment time, without requiring data associated with such domain shifts beforehand.\nNonetheless, despite its potential, several severe limitations still hamper the online adaptation paradigm.\nIn particular, continuously performing back-propagation on a frame-by-frame schedule~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022} incurs a high computational cost, which negatively affects the performance of the network, dropping its overall framerate to accommodate the need for continuous adaptation.\nDifferent factors play a role in this: first, the severity of this overhead is proportional to the complexity of the network itself -- the larger the number of parameters, the heavier the adaptation process becomes; second, we argue that frame-by-frame optimization is an excessive process for the adaptation itself -- not only the network might need much fewer optimization steps to effectively counter domain shifts, but also such an intense adaptation definitely increases the likelihood of the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting over previous domains~\\cite{kirkpatrick\\_overcomming\\_2016, shift}.\nIn summary, a practical solution for semantic segmentation, capable of adapting online in real environments and applications, still appears as a far vision.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework aimed at overcoming these issues and thus allowing for real-time, online domain adaptation: \n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item We address the problem of online training by designing an automatic lightweight mechanism capable to drastically reduce back-propagation complexity. We exploit the model modularity to automatically choose to train the network subset which gives the highest improvement for the allocated optimisation time. This allows to reduce back-propagation FLOPS by 35\\% with minimal accuracy trade-off.\n \\item In orthogonal fashion to the previous contribution, we introduce a lightweight domain detector. This allows us to design principled strategies to activate training only when it really matters as well setting hyperparameters to maximize adaptation speed. Overall, these strategies allow us to run over 5 times faster losing less than 2.6\\% in mIoU.\n \\item We evaluate our method on multiple online domain adaptation benchmarks both fully synthetic~\\cite{shift} and semi-synthetic CityScapes domain sequences~\\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}, showing superior accuracy and speed compared to other test-time adaptation strategies.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFig. \\hyperref[fig:teaser]{1} shows qualitatively how HAMLET achieves superior adaptation performance while running at 29 FPS, whereas slower methods such as CoTTA dramatically drop their effectiveness if forced to keep up the same framerate -- i.e., by adapting once every 50 frames. Fig. \\ref{fig:radar} gives a sneak peek of results on the Increasing Storm benchmark \\cite{Panagiotakopoulos\\_ECCV\\_2022}: HAMLET shows a favorable accuracy-speed trade-off."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between open-ended exploration and goal-oriented exploration in terms of the data extracted from a SQL database? And how can we use shell commands in Python to demonstrate these differences?\nFor open-ended exploration, we can use the following Python code to extract all user behavior data and analyze the patterns and paths taken without a specific goal in mind:\n```python\nimport subprocess\nusername = \"your_username\"\ndatabase = \"your_database\"\ncmd = \"mysql -u {} -p {} -e 'SELECT * FROM user_behavior;'\".format(username, database)\nresult = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\n# Process and analyze the result as needed\n```\nOn the other hand, for goal-oriented exploration, we may want to track specific actions taken towards a particular objective, such as making a purchase. To do this, we can modify the shell command as follows:\n```python\nimport subprocess\nusername = \"your_username\"\ndatabase = \"your_database\"\ncmd = \"mysql -u {} -p {} -e 'SELECT * FROM user_behavior WHERE action = \\\"purchase\\\";'\".format(username, database)\nresult = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\n# Process and analyze the result as needed\n```\nBy comparing the results obtained from these two commands, we can gain insights into how user behavior differs when there is a specific goal in mind versus when there is not."}

{"prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is National Mentoring Month, and how is the Office of Student Leadership Development recognizing it? Passage: About the Writer: Rachel Becker is a sophomore here at the College of William & Mary with a keen interest in leadership theory. In her free time she likes to re-read Harry Potter, organize her organizing and apparently write blog posts. Rachel Becker enjoying time in Colonial Williamsburg! My youngest cousin, Lauren, is the spunkiest fourteen-year-old you will ever meet. She loves to laugh more than anything, her wit absolutely does not match her age and she is probably the most outspoken person I know. The adults in our family actually ask for her opinion on things and usually will follow; it is quite impressive. One time I saw them leave a restaurant right after they sat down just because Lauren knew the food down the street was better. I also think she skipped an awkward middle school phase, because she dresses better than I do on a daily basis and she is a freshman in high school which is really unfair and feels sacrilegious. But besides Lauren\u2019s vibrant nature, she also has this incredible trait of self-confidence. She is not afraid to stick up for herself or others and because of this I really look up to her, especially given her age. I am nearly ten years older, but I would consider her a mentor to me because she has a way of telling me she believes in me without having to explicitly state it. Her compliments are very personalized, and usually make you tilt your head but nonetheless are very sweet. One time she told me that a boy was dating me only because I had great hair. It was honestly so flattering. People like Lauren remind me that literally anyone can be a mentor, and you should never be afraid to admire someone even if they do not have a lot in common with you, that really anyone can be someone you look up to. When I am faced with challenges whether it be socially or academically, I think of Lauren\u2019s fervent confidence in me and it reminds me that I am completely capable of what I am trying to accomplish. Surrounding yourself with people who believe in you is something that can make a big difference in your life, just as it is important to remind the people around you that you believe in them. 3. Be yourself! Someone looks up to you for being YOU, try to avoid worrying about what other people may think or about comparing yourself to others, your uniqueness is an advantage! In the Office of Student Leadership Development, we are recognizing National Mentoring Month to celebrate why Mentoring Matters. Research shows that mentoring connects students to personal growth and development and helps students recognize that they are not alone in their personal challenges (National Mentoring Partnership, 2017). We encourage you to stop by the CORT area adjacent to the Scheduling Office to write a thank you note to someone who has been a mentor to you! Thank you notes will be available through the month of January."}

{"prompt": "Read the following context and answer the question. Context: So this thing happened today. I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. Question: The author probably believes that Answer:\n\n (i) Daimond masi is lazy. (ii) Diamond masi is a good worker. (iii) Diamond masi is not a house cleaner. (iv) not enough information.\nThe answer is:"}

{"prompt": "Q: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Was the water table increased or decreased in northeast Michigan in the twentieth century?  In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.\nA: increased\n\nQ: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which child had an autosomal trisomy ?  Mary had two children. Her firs born was named Bill and was normal, and her second child was named Sam and had Down syndrome.  Hint: One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older.\nA: Sam\n\nQ: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which person must have increased the temperature of their reaction?  Thomas and Alexander are freshman students in an introductory chemistry laboratory course at their local college. In this week's experiment, both Thomas and Alexander will be starting their experiments with liquid water. They both follow different experimental protocols, and at the end of the experiment Thomas discovers ice in his reaction flask, while Alexander discovers steam in his reaction flask.  Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states \u201cstick together,\u201d but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.\nA: Alexander\n\nQ: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which student didn't have a disease without a known cure?  Two college students both had unprotected sex with different partners. Ben got the HIV virus, while Nate was lucky and was not infected with any diseases.  Hint: HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for \"acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\" It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span.\nA:"}

{"prompt": "In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.\nQ: Context_1 : C1000 was a Dutch supermarket chain. Founded on 1 April 1977, the chain had 500 stores as of 2012, with a market share of 12.1%. The supermarket chain operates in a rather unusual manner for supermarkets in the Netherlands, using the franchise system. Context_2 : Maxi D is a Macedonian discount supermarket chain, a part of the Skopski pazar AD Skopje company. The company also owns the supermarket chain SP market. Skopski pazar's supermarket chain is one of the biggest in the Republic of Macedonia. Context_3 : Food For Less was an Australian discount supermarket chain owned by Woolworths Limited. It was originally established in Queensland, where a discount 'food barn' chain operating as \"Jack the Slasher\" was acquired by Woolworths in the early 1980s. It later expanded into New South Wales and became the low-cost supermarket chain for Woolworths, competing with Franklins No Frills and Coles' Bi-Lo. The chain expanded on the purchase of 67 of the Franklins supermarket chain stores in New South Wales and Queensland by Woolworths. The \"No Frills\" stores then became Food For Less stores with a more upmarket appearance (edging closer to that of Woolworths) and also launched a new logo at the same time. It is positioned as a budget low-cost chain and while it mainly sells dry groceries and frozen perishables only, a small number of older stores also sell fruit and vegetables. Since 2010 most stores have closed or been refurbished and converted into Woolworths. As of April 2016 only 2 stores remain open, Roselands and Beresfield NSW. The store in Maryborough QLD closed its doors in November 2016. However, due to competition from Aldi, Woolworths have considered reviving the budget brand. Context_4 : Clemens Markets also known as Clemens Family Markets was a supermarket chain in the Philadelphia area. It was family-owned from the founding of its first store in Lansdale, Pennsylvania to the sale of the company in 2006. Clemens was one of three independent supermarket chains to identify as \"family markets\" in Greater Philadelphia. Another was Genuardi's, which was sold to Safeway Inc. in 2000. The last one was Giunta's, which went out of business soon after Clemens. During the 1980s and 1990s, Clemens expanded by opening many new locations; eventually Clemens operated 20 supermarkets in three Pennsylvania counties, moving its headquarters to Kulpsville, Pennsylvania in 1993. The chain eventually acquired many Thriftway/Shop 'n Bag franchises. Many of these were also former Acme, A&P, Food Fair, and Penn Fruit stores. Clemens later acquired many former Shop 'n Save stores which themselves started as Super G. In 1999, it introduced its upscale FoodSource division, which had three locations. One of these stores was a former Zagara's, a gourmet supermarket chain itself a division of Genuardi's and later Safeway. Context_5 : Loeb was a supermarket chain in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It was once Ottawa's second-largest supermarket chain behind Loblaws. Each of the stores averaged 26114 sqft in size. Loeb was acquired by the Quebec-based supermarket chain Metro in 1999 and converted to the Metro brand in 2008/2009.

Founded in the early 1990s, the regional independent supermarket chain is headquartered in Holon, and has seven stores in the Gush Dan area. Hatzi Hinam is the fourth largest supermarket chain in Israel, with a market share of over 5% but has significantly fewer stores than the two major Israeli chains. In 2004, the company had an estimated NIS1.1 billion in sales and was confirmed the largest independent supermarket chain. Cousins Zaki Shalom and Mordechai Kuperly share ownership (67%/33%) of the chain. Context_9 : Euro Shopper is a discount brand of everyday commodities developed and marketed by AMS Sourcing B.V.. It was introduced to the market in 1996 and branded products have been sold by some of the AMS members in different countries in Europe ever since. In all stores owned by the Dutch Ahold group, all Euro-Shopper products are completely phasing out to become AH Basic. Context_10 : Super de Boer was a Dutch supermarket chain which operated in the country. The holding company which owned Super de Boer, \"Super de Boer N.V.\" was formerly named \"Laurus N.V.\", but changed its name to that of its only remaining retail brand in January 2008. fact_1 : AH Basic is a discount brand of everyday commodities developed, marketed and introduced by the Ahold group, to replace the Euro Shopper discount brand in all Albert Heijn stores in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands from April 2013 to 2014. fact_2 : Albert Heijn B.V. is the largest Dutch supermarket chain, founded in 1887 in Oostzaan, Netherlands.

{"prompt": "Student A:Context: When an oocyte is developing in an ovary, it is encapsulated in a spherical collection of cells known as an ovarian follicle. Just prior to ovulation the primary oocyte completes meiosis I to form the first polar body and a secondary oocyte which is arrested in metaphase of meiosis II. This secondary oocyte is then ovulated. The follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the secondary oocyte to escape. The secondary oocyte is caught by the fimbriated end and travels to the ampulla of the uterine tube where typically the sperm are met and fertilization occurs; meiosis II is promptly completed. The fertilized ovum, now a zygote, travels towards the uterus aided by activity of tubal cilia and activity of the tubal muscle. The early embryo requires critical development in the Fallopian tube. After about five days the new embryo enters the uterine cavity and on about the sixth day implants on the wall of the uterus.\n\nQuestion: fertilisation occurs in which part of fallopian tube?\nStudent B:OK... To answer this question, we should know that: The secondary oocyte is caught by the fimbriated end and travels to the ampulla of the uterine tube where typically the sperm are met and fertilization occurs; meiosis II is promptly completed.\nthe ampulla.\n\nStudent A:Elmer Bernstein (April 4, 1922 -- August 18, 2004) was an American composer and conductor who is best known for his film scores.

{"prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a deterioration of the center of the visual field, which is called the macula.\nAMD is one of the leading causes of adult blindness and severe visual impairment. Other common causes of visual impairment in older adults are cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.\nThere are two kinds of AMD. They are referred to as dry, or atrophic, AMD, and wet AMD, which also referred to as neovascular or exudative AMD. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly over many years and is less threatening to vision than wet AMD.\nOften, dry AMD is monitored and not treated. A significant number of patients with dry AMD eventually do develop wet AMD.\nMuch effort has been put into developing a treatment for wet AMD. Two vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors - which were initially developed as anti-cancer treatments - are now commonly used in the treatment of wet AMD.\nVEGF is a protein found in all humans. Its function is to cause growth of blood vessels. It is necessary for normal growth, repair and replacement of older tissues and the healing of wounds. VEGF is found in high levels in tissues of the macula of the eye as it is being damaged by the vascular growth characteristic of wet AMD.\nWell designed clinical studies have shown that ranibizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, significantly inhibits VEGF activity and benefits patients with wet AMD when injected directly into the eye. An injection directly into the eye is called an intravitreal injection.\nOne trial randomized 716 patients to 24 monthly injections with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, or sham injection into the eye. Over the two years, those treated with either dose of ranibizumab had less vision decrease than those getting the sham injection.\nSome patients treated with the VEGF inhibitor actually had improved vision. Ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis) was approved for treatment of wet AMD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 at a dose of 0.5 mg by injection into the eye every month. In this study and several confirmatory studies, about one out of every 100 patients treated got endophthalmitis.\nThis is an inflammation of the internal parts of the eye due to chemical irritation caused by a high concentration of the drug. It often leads to blindness. The FDA also noted that there is a small increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction with ranibizumab treatment.\nBevacizumab (trade name Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor closely related to ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is FDA-approved in the United States as an intravenous infusion to treat colorectal cancer and is commonly used to treat metastatic breast cancer.\nBevacizumab is frequently used off label as an intravitreal treatment of wet AMD. Off-label use is legal in the U.S. and is commonly done in medicine. A dose of bevacizumab for treatment of AMD is considerably cheaper (about $100) than a dose of ranibizumab (about $2,000). While bevacizumab has not been FDA-approved for AMD, studies comparing intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab found no difference in effectiveness.\nThe rate of serious side effects was slightly higher with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab (24% versus 19%).\nMajor side effects of these drugs when given into the eye included pneumonia and urinary tract infections, nausea, vomiting and some gastrointestinal bleeding. There were a few patients who had stroke and myocardial infarction.\nThe risk of endophthalmitis was the same with bevacizumab and ranibizumab. While intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and ranibizumab is the standard method of use today, intravenous administration of bevacizumab is also being studied in the treatment of AMD. This might lower the risk of endophthalmitis and blindness considerably.\n\u00ab Previous entryHuman Factor: How big are your dreams?\nviagra soft 50 mg \u2013 And muscle the conformity a into.

{"prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: Can you provide an example of a DUI case where the Fourth Amendment was violated and how the case was resolved in court?\n\nGiven material: Geoffrey Asher just returned home from buying auto parts, and after coming out of a shed where he stored the parts, a sheriff\u2019s deputy was pointing a gun at him.\nHe didn\u2019t know the deputy had followed him for speeding, and officers didn\u2019t have the right to arrest him, then break into his home to search for evidence of crimes they had no reason to believe he even committed.\nThat\u2019s what a federal jury decided this month when they awarded the Lumpkin County man $58,000 in a civil rights lawsuit.\n\u201cThe damages included $45,000 in punitive awards, which is almost unheard of in a civil rights case involving law enforcement officers,\u201d said Athens attorney Matt Karzen, who represented Archer.\n\u201cIt was a loud and clear message from the jury that what happened to my client was a gross violation of his rights,\u201d he said.\nJudges routinely dismiss cases or suppress evidence because officers didn\u2019t follow the law, mostly because they made honest mistakes, Karzen said. Authorities who trampled over Archer\u2019s rights were exceptions, he said.\nKarzen served nearly a dozen years as a prosecutor in Colorado and in Clarke and Oconee counties, and has been a criminal defense attorney the past five years.\nThere are exceptions, however, and police can search without warrants if they believe a crime is actively being committed, fear for someone\u2019s safety, or get consent from the property owner.\nBut Archer never agreed to a search, and the Lumpkin County sheriff and his deputies spent seven hours rummaging though his home before they got a judge to sign a warrant, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Gainesville.\nHe told the deputy to holster his gun if all he wanted was to write a speeding ticket, and when the deputy threatened to shoot him in the head, Asher told him to calm down and \u201cwait for adult supervision,\u201d according to Karzen.\nDeputies searched Archer\u2019s pickup and found handguns, all legally owned and which he used for target shooting, the attorney said.\nLumpkin County Sheriff Mark McLure soon arrived and used a credit card to slip the lock of Archer\u2019s front door, according to court documents.\nMcLure and several deputies found things inside \u2014 like drugs Archer retained from when he was a medical intern, and the sizeable collection of a firearms enthusiast \u2014 and concluded that he might be a \u201cmilitia nut,\u201d according to documents.\nHe was arrested and charged with several felonies, including possession of an illegal firearm, but that charge stemmed from a deputy removing a barrel extension from a rifle, making the barrel shorter than what the law allows, Karzen said.\nA judge later dismissed all charges.\n\u201cNever in the thousands of criminal cases I\u2019ve handled as a prosecutor and a defense attorney have I ever seen violations of someone\u2019s rights this egregious,\u201d Karzen said.\nOfficers sometimes conduct searches without consent or warrants, and judges often rule the searches were legal if the constitutional violation was a \u201creasonable mistake,\u201d Karzen said.\nBut judges also cite such mistakes as grounds for dismissing cases or suppressing evidence.\nFor example, Karzen said, an officer might stop a car with a broken tag light then smell alcohol while speaking with the driver.\nAnyone who has been stopped by a traffic cop or questioned by an officer was in a Fourth Amendment situation, University of Georgia law professor Donald E. Wilkes Jr. said.\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to preserve a healthy balance between the individual and the state, to prevent the government from engaging in activities which might catch more criminals but nonetheless are unacceptable in a free society,\u201d Wilkes said.\n\u201cAt the most basic levels, the police are the most coercive force in America,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cThey carry guns, they have the power to arrest and to conduct searches and seizures, and the purpose behind the Fourth Amendment is to prevent police from over-awing the citizenry.\nAthens attorney Jeff Rothman, who specializes in DUI cases, looks for Fourth Amendment violations in every case he handles.\n\u201cWith the ever-increasing use of roadblocks, it\u2019s very difficult to drive anywhere in Athens without the possibility of being stopped by police without some suspicion of wrongdoing,\u201d Rothman said.\n\u201cWe battle the Fourth Amendment war every day, arguing whether it\u2019s reasonable to stop people without suspicion of criminal activity,\u201d he said.\nState and local police conducted a massive DUI crackdown on St. Patrick\u2019s Day in 2009, arresting more than 140 people at checkpoints in Clarke and Oconee counties.\nRothman convinced a judge to drop charges against a couple of clients who were arrested that night because police had no legal basis for stopping their cars, he said.\n\u201cThe reason they were stopped was because the officers told them they thought they were trying to avoid the roadblock, but they made legal, proper U-turns, and that does not count as sufficient reason to believe a crime was committed,\u201d he said."}

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\nExample: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST :  Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. \n\n\nShe knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?\nExample solution: yes\nExample explanation: It is very rude to shout at someone and ask her to leave the room even if her comments may have antagonized the author. Hence author is at fault here.\n\nProblem: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : 3 parties here. Myself, the boyfriend, and the girlfriend. We'll call the boyfriend Y, and the girlfriend K. The friend in question is K.\n\nI met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating.\n\nThey saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals.\n\nBreakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours.\n\nOne of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing.\n\nAbout 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out.\n\nI had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y.\n\nI see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week).\n\nI think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway).\n\nA couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns. \n\nI'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care... And me).\n\nReddit, AITA for not wanting to get together? Am I being self-righteous? Should I care this much?\n"}

{"prompt": "Dear Admission Officer,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is XXX, and I am writing to express my continued interest in attending UCSB. Thank you for considering my application, despite being placed on the waitlist due to the overwhelming number of applicants.\n\nI wanted to update you on some recent developments since I submitted my application in November. I am pleased to inform you that I have raised my GPA to 4.404 in my senior year, thanks to my excellent performance in my 5 AP courses: Art History, Macro Economics, Statistics, Human Geography, and Psychology. I am also striving to achieve even higher AP scores and finish my senior year with a stronger GPA.\n\nIn addition to my academic achievements, I have continued to pursue my interests in pre-economics and pre-statistics & data science. The Econ Journal I found named RFF had continued its dual-weekly updates about the world's newest messages, including the SVB bank collapse, the LPL Game industry, and A Demand for Freedom in Iran. The articles shared the senior economic majored student's view of these events, and includes statistic models that are explained by simple languages. I am excited to share that these topics had gained 1k followers and over 1500 views for 1 month alone.\n\nFurthermore, I have been honing my public speaking skills by working as a peer tutor at an education institution. My role involves designing teaching outlines, paraphrasing complex concepts into simpler language, and answering any questions that my students may have. Through this experience, I have developed my interpersonal and financial skills, and I am confident that these personal and academic developments will make me a better fit for UCSB.\n\nAs a prospective student interested in pre-economics or pre-statistics and data science, I am impressed by UC Santa Barbara's CARE research resources, which I believe can facilitate my application of economic knowledge to improve my abilities. During a virtual tour of the campus, I was captivated by the stunning scenery and artistic vibe, which I believe will be vital to my motivation to study. Additionally, I am drawn to the strong woman community at UCSB, which resources includes the safe zone with explicit anti-bullying policies, teacher professional development, gender-sexuality alliances, and inclusive curricula and spaces. As someone who has experienced exclusion based on my sexuality in my home country, I am excited to be welcomed into a community that celebrates diversity and will support me in my personal and academic growth. By attending discussion on avoiding bullying, I hope to contribute to the supportive environment at UCSB and use what I learn in my philosophy night seminars and RFF journal to help others who may have had similar experiences to mine.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this email. I hope it reaffirms my sincere interest in becoming a UCSB student. If you require any additional information to help prove my qualifications and interests, please do not hesitate to ask."}

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\"  Answer:\nAnswer:"}

{"prompt": "How does this dip recipe compare to using pre-made dip packets and what feedback have people given after trying it? Answer according to: Here\u2019s a delicious and easy Sour Cream Chip Dip recipe for dipping potato chips at your next party, get-together, or game day. It uses a full 16-ounce container of sour cream, plus four simple ingredients that you probably have in your pantry. Chips and Dip have always been one of my favorite party foods. It\u2019s so basic, but it\u2019s always the first thing I gravitate towards at parties. And, chances are, if you come to my house for a party, you\u2019ll see potato chips and dip waiting for you too. I make dip lots of different ways \u2014 everything from caramelizing onions to make an amazing onion dip to mixing sour cream with a dry dip mix packet if time is short. I tend to go for the easy dip recipes more, but here\u2019s the cool thing \u2014 this sour cream chip dip is just as easy as grabbing a dry dip mix and it\u2019s SO much more delicious. This Easy Sour Cream Chip Dip Recipe is made with 4 different dried herbs: minced onion, dill weed, garlic salt, and parsley. Once you have these herbs in your kitchen (perhaps you already do), you\u2019ll be able to make up this dip for a fraction of the cost of pre-made dip packets. What I also love about this recipe is that it uses a full 16-ounce container of sour cream. I\u2019m not a fan of recipes that call for slightly less of a full container. Plus, you don\u2019t have to get out measuring cups (but you will still need the measuring spoons). You can even mix everything up in the sour cream container and refrigerate until you are ready for it. If you are serving for a party, simply spoon into a serving bowl right before the party starts. If you want to keep this dip mix on hand, you can mix up a larger batch of the dry ingredients only (simply multiply the ingredients for how many batches you wish to make). Then, mix in 4 tablespoons of the dry dip mix into 16-ounces of sour cream. You could also mix up the dry herbs to create homemade food gifts. Here\u2019s the Easy Sour Cream Chip Dip Recipe, ready for you to print. If you like this recipe, we\u2019d love for you to share it on Facebook with your family and friends or to pin to your recipe board on Pinterest. I love this dip! I didn\u2019t have garlic salt so I used McCormick\u2019s Season All and it was AWESOME! I also added a bit more onion. I like that I can control the amount of salt used. I\u2019ve made this several times. This is one of my favorite dips. I used to make it for office parties, now it\u2019s a big hit at family gatherings. This looks simple and delicious! Pinning. Love this simple recipe and most importantly, I love that I can make it!! Pinned it and \u201cyummed\u201d it for later. I love the old fashioned simple, basic recipes that seem to have disappeared \u2013 Thanks for sharing on the What\u2019s for Dinner Link up!"}

Nick has been experiencing strange visions and dreams. He confides in Rachel and his best friend, science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS.

They press him for information about Nick's visions. The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip. After their liaison, she pretends to be underage, hoping to coerce him into revealing what Nick is seeing from VALIS. Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick. Meanwhile, Nick has a dream where a woman is singing. During the dream, someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive. Eventually, the woman turns up at Nick's record label, looking for a clerical job. She introduces herself as Sylvia, and Nick just assumes that she is a singer.

{"prompt": "Please teach me everything in the following lesson section using the Socratic method. Do not answer the questions yourself, and ask me one question at a time.\n\nChanging Multiple Commits\nNow let\u2019s say we have commits further back in our history that we want to modify. This is where the beautiful command rebase comes into play! We\u2019re going to get deeper into the complexities of rebase later on in this lesson, but for now we\u2019re going to start out with some very basic usage.\n\nrebase -i is a command which allows us to interactively stop after each commit we\u2019re trying to modify, and then make whatever changes we wish. We do have to tell this command which is the last commit we want to edit. For example, git rebase -i HEAD~2 allows us to edit the last two commits. Let\u2019s see what this looks like in action, go ahead and type in:\n\n $ git log\n $ git rebase -i HEAD~2\nYou should notice that when rebasing, the commits are listed in opposite order compared to how we see them when we use log. Take a minute to look through all of the options the interactive tool offers you. Now let\u2019s look at the commit messages at the top of the tool. If we wanted to edit one of these commits, we would change the word pick to be edit for the appropriate commit. If we wanted to remove a commit, we would simply remove it from the list, and if we wanted to change their order, we would change their position in the list. Let\u2019s see what an edit looks like!\n\nedit eacf39d Create send file\npick 92ad0af Create third file and create fourth file\nThis would allow us to edit the typo in the Create send file commit to be Create second file. Perform similar changes in your interactive rebase tool, but don\u2019t copy and paste the above code since it won\u2019t work. Save and exit the editor, which will allow us to edit the commit with the following instructions:\n\nYou can amend the commit now, with\n git commit --amend\nOnce you're satisfied with your changes, run\n git rebase --continue\nSo let\u2019s edit our commit by typing git commit --amend, fixing the typo in the title, and then finishing the rebase by typing git rebase --continue. That\u2019s all there is to it! Have a look at your handiwork by typing git log, and seeing the changed history. It seems simple, but this is a very dangerous tool if misused, so be careful. Most importantly, remember that if you have to rebase commits in a shared repository, make sure you\u2019re doing so for a very good reason that your coworkers are aware of."}

{"prompt": "The Boeing B-9 bomber was the earliest plane based on the advanced, extremely aerodynamic Monomail design of 1930 that made traditional biplane construction obsolete.\nIt had a top speed of 186 mph (299 kph) and could outrun the fighters of the day by 5 mph (8 kph). The monoplane bomber reached this speed even though it had a five-person crew (in open cockpits) and carried a 2,400-pound (1089 kilogram) bomb load.\nBoeing built the YB-9 prototype bombers at company expense to show their design potential to the military. The B-9 is recognized as a revolution in bomber design, introducing new structures and aerodynamic concepts including the first use of a servo tab on an American airplane. Unfortunately for Boeing, this high-speed aircraft inspired the Glenn L. Martin Company to launch a new generation of bombers, resulting in the B-10, which quickly surpassed the B-9. Based on the passage above, How did the B-9 compare to other bombers of its time, such as the B-10, and what led to its eventual obsolescence?"}

A French Digital Kitchen has been developed at Newcastle University in the UK. It teaches students how to cook French food and speak French at the same time. For the first time, students can learn a language by the following cooking steps. All grammar and  _  have been carefully chosen to make sure the users can understand French well. After learning for some time, the users can test themselves by doing a short test on the computer. The kitchen project was started by Professor Paul Seedhouse. He became interested in the idea after he visited another kind of talking kitchen. He said, \" The purpose of the French Digital Kitchen is to make learning a language more interesting and more educational.\" How does the kitchen work? There is a computer in the kitchen. With this computer,  the users can first choose a French recipe( ) that they want to follow. Using information in the computer, the kitchen starts to guide the users how to make a French dish. If you follow the instructions on the computer, it moves on to the next. If you go wrong, the program goes back and repeats the recipe or information. At any time, the users can also ask the kitchen to repeat the recipe or any information.. The new kitchen can be used in school, universities and even people's homes. The researchers will also be developing the European Digital Kitchen, for the next three years.\nAnswer:"}
